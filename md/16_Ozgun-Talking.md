# Talking To Strangers: Temporality, Identity and Politics in Live Webcam Sex Channels

### Aras Ozgun

Immediacy has been a constitutive characteristic of electronic and
online communications from the very beginning. E-mail, instant
messaging, bulletin boards and user forums, and later RSS
technologies[^16_Ozgun-Talking_1] and social media networks have relied on the immediacy
of information exchange, and have gradually replaced traditional forms
of interpersonal written communications. The emergence of electronic
text —writing on the screen— has radically altered the ontology of text
as had existed before in the print cultures, by depriving it of its
authoritative permanence, destabilizing it and making it dynamic,
ever-changing, and temporal. Up until recently, because of a variety of
technological limitations, this ‘instantaneousness’ remained confined to
the exchange of this new kind of (electronic) ‘text’. Although digital
media platforms and networks had the potential to connect distant
people, locations and events, not only textually but audio-visually as
well, this potential has been limited by availability of access to the
networks, bandwidth, and technical equipment. Over the past few years,
with the increasing popularity of camera-equipped smart phones, laptops,
and wireless and mobile data networks, these limitations have been
largely surpassed.

This development has an obvious practical impact primarily on
face-to-face communications: Skyping, using Facetime, and video chatting
increasingly substitute or supplement face-to-face communications in
general. However, the potential of webcam for one-to-many
communications, as a ‘broadcasting’ device, is still neglected or
unfulfilled, and this is largely due to the economic logic of media
industries rather than technological limitations. ‘Televisuality’—that
is, the immediate and live transmission of events, which has been the
definitive power of TV - still remains under the monopoly of television
networks. The emergence of the webcam as a technological form only
marginally challenges the monopoly of television in defining social time
and collective temporality. ‘Real-time,’ as a term that refers to a
computer’s capacity to render image streams continuously while they are
being displayed on the monitor (or, any other process in which the
tangible results/effects of the process is simultaneously displayed),
emerged with the introduction of digital media technologies to
distinguish this new form of temporal immediacy from the latency of
print cultures. Yet, the ‘real-time’ of social life in general
ironically remained associated with television. Television networks
sustained their monopoly over the information regarding what is
happening at that very moment. So far, except substituting face-to-face
communications, the Internet has provided a vast archive of past
‘moments’ of collectively experienced ‘real-time,’ in the form of
digital video recordings, shared and made available online on YouTube,
Vimeo or other social media networks. The instant availability of such a
wide video archive had been a fascination in new media studies during
the second decade of online communications. Before us now is another
potential; a new, truly decentralized technological form of television
(that does not require the massive organizational structure of corporate
television networks) available to individuals. This creates new temporal
depths apart from the hegemonic time regimes constructed and sustained
by television networks. What I am going to discuss in this article, live
webcam sex channels, is one of these marginal instances in which online
video challenges television in its own realm, and claims the rights over
‘live-ness.’ I will argue that the ‘live-ness’ of the webcam constitutes
a new type of reality effect, which I will provisionally call
‘realness.’ In the last part of the article, I will analyze a particular
interaction that occurs in Turkish live webcam sex channels as a result
of such realness, in which feminine desire falls into confrontation with
patriarchal moralism, which leads to a productive crisis that makes
enjoyment impossible.

## “I see, therefore I am”: The Ontology of Televisuality

The ontology of the webcam is that of television on a minor scale; it
possesses the same ‘live-ness’ and ‘immediacy.’ ‘Live-ness’ of the
televisual image, as pointed out by many media theorists from Raymond
Williams to Mary Ann Doane, provides television with a unique potential
for relating to the event it presents. In this respect, the televisual
image has an ‘ontic’ condition, in Heidegger’s terms. Martin Heidegger
used ‘ontic’ in reference to the undeniable existential quality of
being, of things and events, which surpass any ontological inquiry.[^16_Ozgun-Talking_2]
We can inquire into how we perceive the outside world, how we gather our
knowledge of things and events, but we cannot deny the existence of
things and events— that was the ontic condition of being, according to
Heidegger.

The tense of the image, its perpetual reference to the present,
distinguishes the iconic signifier of television from that of cinema and
photograph. The ‘live-ness’ of the televisual image transfers the ontic
quality of the things and events it depicts to the screen they appear
on; the televisual image thus possesses undeniable presence of the
outside world it shows. We can always question how things and events are
represented to us on the television screen; we can always associate
particular instances of such representation with ideological
constructions beyond epistemological questions; we can always remain
doubtful about the “truth value” of these representations and question
what is really happening there; but we can never deny that what
television shows us does exist somewhere at that very moment. The
“truth” of the televisual representation is primarily the event itself;
that something happens at that very moment. “What happened, really?” is
a posterior concern.

The webcam image claims the same ontic quality in a similar way; the
existence of what it shows us on the other end of the line at that very
moment is undeniable, beyond any questions regarding its identity and
its truthfulness. The early incarnations of webcams were online cameras
placed in various remote locations from Antarctica to Times Square.
These webcams did not attempt to impress the Internet-savvy voyeurs with
the photographic quality of their low-resolution pictures, which were
only updated in every few seconds, but indeed fascinated them with a
different type of realism—with their temporal reference. They quietly,
without any commentary, showed us what was going on at a remote part of
the world, somewhere that exists beyond our sight at that very moment.
Against the hyper-realism of larger-than-life LCD billboards,
multi-monitor TV walls, high-precision satellite imagery and HD
projections on every facade, the tiny pixelated webcam image offered the
realism of a ‘trace’ rather than a map, of a silhouette rather than a
portrait. The uncanny truth of the jerky video stream recalled a
Vertovian dream amid the spectacle of high-tech visual media: ‘life as
it is,’ at that very moment. What becomes clearly expressed in the
intensified eroticism of live webcam sex channels, in their seductive
power, as I will try to explain below, is this temporal reference—the
extended sight that simply registers what exists there at that moment,
beyond any question regarding its ‘representation.’

After the proliferation of bandwidth and camera equipped computers, a
17-year-old Russian high school student, Andrey Ternovsky, cultivated
the true nature of the webcam by combining it with two other
constitutive characteristics of online communications: anonymity and
interactivity. The algorithm Ternovsky deployed on the site he founded,
Chatroulette, allowed the users to randomly connect to other users
through their webcams. In complete anonymity, users could video chat
with others, perform acts for complete strangers, just look at each
other, or try to catch another’s attention before he or she clicked on
the ‘next’ button - or if all failed, to just hit the ‘next’ button and
jump to another random user’s webcam. Without any advertisement, the
users of Ternovsky’s Chatroulette exponentially grew; when the site
launched in November 2009, it initially drew 500 visitors per day.
Within a month, there were fifty thousand daily users, and Chatroulette
is still one of the top five video chat sites in the world. [^16_Ozgun-Talking_3]

The popularity of Chatroulette revealed the erotic potential of the
medium. According to an informal study published in 2010, hitting the
“next” button on Chatroulette yielded a 1 in 8 chance of seeing someone
apparently naked, exposing themselves or engaging in a sexual act, a
considerable chance of seeing a ‘show your tits’ sign, and a
considerably lesser chance of seeing actual female flashers.[^16_Ozgun-Talking_4] The
amount of users seeking erotic pleasure and anonymously exhibiting
themselves on the site eventually generated a series of public
controversies, to the degree that Ternovsky finally had to modify the
website’s program to detect skin tone and block nudity, and employ users
with ‘moderator’ privileges to filter out obscenity.

Webcam sex sites that appeared in the recent years were built on the
idea of providing an open space for what has been excluded from
Chatroulette and other video chat sites: nudity, obscenity,
exhibitionist thrill, voyeuristic orgy, purely and intensely erotic
communication.

Although the content of most popular live webcam sex sites are open to
all adult Internet users, they are economically sustained through paid
membership as well as advertisement revenues.[^16_Ozgun-Talking_5] Any adult Internet
user (or, in fact, any Internet user who confirms that she or he is over
18 years old) can access the sites and follow the broadcasts. The
members whose webcams are open, who are visible to other viewers, are
marked as ‘broadcasting.’ The use of the term ‘broadcasting,’ a term
borrowed from television in this context, once again reminds us the
closeness between TV and the webcam as a technological form. The
broadcasting members are listed according to their self-declared sexual
preferences, under the sections: female, male, transsexual and couples
(not necessarily heterosexual). Different sites offer different extra
categories, such as the ‘party’ category on cam4.com (in which a group
of people gather in front of the webcam), or ‘featured broadcasts’
(which include the performers selected by the sites administrators). The
listings of members performing/broadcasting at that moment in each
section of the sites are displayed in order of popularity—meaning that
the performers with more viewers are displayed on the top of list. On
cam4.com and chaturbate.com, top-ranking performers can draw an audience
of a few thousand members depending on the time of day. Membership,
although free, is a requirement for broadcasting. Members can also
purchase ‘tokens,’ which can be offered and transferred to other
members. Members who receive tokens from other members can convert these
tokens to cash, and the site operators cut a commission from this
exchange. Token exchange sustains the economy of the sites as well as
facilitating the sex work they provide.

My interest is not in the economic aspects of the sex work on these
channels. The income derived from performing sex work on webcam must
differ hugely from performer to performer, and it is difficult to
estimate it without an in-depth analysis of overall exchange. As I’ll
try to explain later, the fact that not all performers seek sex work,
plus the fact that sex work and erotic pleasure become almost
indistinguishable on these sites, makes it difficult to analyze the
volume and intensity of the sex work without referring to the site
operators’ records. While pointing to the erosion of the perceivable
difference between sex work and erotic play, I also acknowledge the fact
that these are already fluid and problematic categories, and I don’t
intend to espouse a clear-cut, hierarchical distinction based on moral
standards between these. My interest is in the psychodynamics and
sociodynamics of this particular form of communication, in which further
indiscernibility of these loose categories becomes an important feature.
This indiscernibility, as I will argue, while intensifying the erotic
thrill, also generates a crisis in the patriarchal language. This is
crystallized in the interactions between Turkish female performers and
male audience.

Among these dynamics, what becomes immediately recognizable is a
heightened sense of anonymity. At the basic level, the anonymity of the
webcam offers certain conveniences, such as providing a safe space for
the expression of uncommon forms of desire in respect to erotic
imagination, and in respect to sex work. Additionally, one does not have
to leave home to watch a strip show, nor does a performer need to drive
to a different city’s strip club to avoid being recognized by their
neighbors.

Anonymity is not only something convenient for circumventing the moral
norms and taboos surrounding sexuality, but it is also a vehicle for
constructing virtual identities. Combined with the intensity and
interactivity of communication that is involved, anonymity creates the
grounds for a few different layers of indiscernibility, which I consider
to be the constitutive element of the medium that provides its distinct
seductive power.

The first layer of indiscernibility is between the performers and the
audience: audience members turn on their cameras and perform too while
watching each other performing; performers sometimes participate in each
other’s sessions; and performers can turn on the viewers’ cam and make
them a part of the performance as such. In this respect, webcam channels
resemble the form of a ‘carnival’ in the Bakhtinian sense. Russian
Formalist literary theorist and philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin was pointing
to the carnival form in his analysis of polyphony and dialogism in
narratives: As a non-scripted event that is constituted by its
participants, a carnival can only be experienced through participation
as such, and does not leave any space for passive “spectatorship.” [^16_Ozgun-Talking_6]

Another layer of indiscernibility, which I find to be even more
important for constructing the seductive power of the medium, appears
between the professional sex workers, who perform regularly (sometimes
every day, sometimes even all day, every day) as a means of subsistence,
the amateur sex workers, who casually perform to earn extra money, and
the common exhibitionists and voyeurs who just seek erotic pleasure. It
is this layer of indiscernibility that blurs the distinction between sex
work and erotic thrill and provides the perfect ground for fantasy,
giving the webcam its seductive power.

We can see this at work when we look at the most popular performers’
channels. Contrary to the common wisdom, the rankings that are apparent
in the listings show that the popularity of the performers does not
directly correlate with their physical attractiveness or attributes (in
other words, the conformity of their physical appearance with the
hegemonic conventions of ‘beauty’), or how much nudity they display, or
how explicit their broadcast is and to what distances they go to satisfy
their audience.

## ‘Realness’ of the Webcam Image: Benefit of the Doubt

Oftentimes the popularity of performers is related to their ability to
construct ‘verisimilitude’ - an effect that I will provisionally call
‘realness.’ ‘Realness’ is an immediate effect of a direct, unprocessed,
unscripted and unedited visual reference - something with which we are
now becoming familiar, by the multitude of cell phone and amateur video
images we are being exposed to in our everyday communication
environment. What I call ‘realness’ here is, on one hand, a certain kind
of ‘reality effect’ that is somehow different from and opposed to what
we find in Hollywood narratives, and, on the other hand, a strategy that
is born out of such layers of indiscernibility that is inherent to this
particular form of communication.

‘Realness,’ as such, is embedded in the ‘live-ness’ of the webcam.
‘Live-ness’ appears to be an integral part of the erotic pleasure, to
the degree that, although the streaming of a "pre-recorded" video feed
to the site (instead of the live video image from the webcam) is
technically and practically possible, this is considered ‘cheating’ and
it is highly undesirable among webcam users. The sites are therefore
designed with a particular administrative attention to sustain
‘live-ness’; the audience is given the chance to mark the performers’
feeds that they determine to be “recorded" and these channels appear
marked as such on the listing page. ‘Live-ness’ is an essential element
for the ‘realness’ of the webcam, to the effect that ‘recorded’ is a
synonym for ‘fake.’

The ‘live-ness’ of the performance includes (or, it is constructed
through) the performer’s interaction with the audience. This interaction
does not merely consist of passively responding to the demands of the
audience to perform sexual acts, but largely, and more profoundly, and
sometimes counterintuitively, sustained by talking with them, engaging
with them communicatively. At various intensities, interaction ranges
from passive communication (such as "hey joe, you are here again?") to
in-depth, intimate personal conversations that do not necessarily
revolve around sexual topics.

Such conversations construct the ‘realness’ of the performer as an
individual, as a social subject, as a desiring subject, and not as a sex
worker who submits herself to her customers’ desires. At the moment that
such ‘realness’ is constructed by the performer, the difference between
erotic play and sex work becomes indiscernible, and the flow of desire,
the erotic exchange, appears to be authentic.

It is possible to see female performers in these sites in heavy makeup,
lying down naked in bed in front of Manhattan-skyline wallpaper, lit
with pink and purple lamps, masturbating all day and just asking for
tokens with a big forced smile on their face all the time. This is
obviously sex work, and in fact, what is displayed bare here is the
reality of the sex work. But no matter how good-looking these women are
and what sort of challenges they undertake, what often draws more
audience are the female performers who appear at home, on a laptop
computer in their bed, or at work, in rather casual situations,
interacting with their audience ‘as they are.’

A cam4.com member, Shygirl652, regularly broadcasts from a library.
Without showing her face, she places the camera between her legs and
plays with herself under her skirt, or places it on the desk and
unbuttons her shirt, and from time to time turns the camera around to
show other people working on the desks behind her. Stella, another
cam4.com member, typically broadcasts from her jewelry shop, exposes
herself in the store when there are no customers, or even in front of
the shop when the street is empty. A few performers regularly broadcast
discreetly from their workplaces while doing their day jobs, and their
discretion while exposing themselves to the webcam becomes a part of the
thrill for the audience as well. Yet, all these performers accept
tokens, and the ‘realness’ of the ‘coworker exposing herself’ shatters
only if the audience is presented with a ‘workspace’ composed of a desk
in an empty room and the performer does not do any work other than
exposing herself and asking for tokens.

Exchange of tokens, and the performers demand for tokens for continuing
the show can be considered as a marker of sex work. But even this is not
a clear marker, since it is possible to see the sex workers appearing on
their channel declaring they are not ‘working,’ they are just there to
‘talk,’ and socialize with their audience. In some cases, the performers
who don’t accept tokens - and therefore appear as they are only
interested in erotic pleasure - draw their audience to other sources of
commercial exchange. For example, *BusinessLady* describes herself as a
sexually active financially secure professional businesswoman who is
seeking erotic thrill on chaturbate.com.[^16_Ozgun-Talking_7] She writes on her profile
page; “I work hard and have way too much stress in my life… I do this
for fun. I don't get to read much of the screen because I am busy
pleasuring myself… If you join my room and I do not seem to be putting
on a show, it is because I am resting. I may work on cam, and have even
read articles aloud to viewers. It may be boring, so change the
channel.” She explains the fact that she accepts token as: “Any tokens /
tips are donated to a respected 501(c)(3) animal rescue charity. I wish
I could prove this, but it really is the truth.” But her profile page
directs her more than 6,500 followers to her personal blog on Blogspot,
where she shares her experiences and fantasies in writing, and also
offers a paid membership for her fan club that gives free “phone sex in
every other month” and privileged treatment for “free private 1 on 1
camera time.”

*Vnmses*, who is one of the most popular performers on that same site,
whenever she is online, gives us one of the best examples of ‘realness’
as such.[^16_Ozgun-Talking_8] Her performances are almost intimate live-broadcasts of the
everyday life of a dissatisfied suburban American teenager. In contrast
with the heavy makeup and forced welcoming smile of the third-world sex
workers on the site, whenever she turns it on, *Vnmses* looks through
her webcam with curious big eyes, and a serious face that searches for a
smile. She talks to her audience/friends before she goes to sleep and
when she wakes up, while she hangs out naked around her suburban house,
while she steals her mother’s wine from the fridge, when she lounges in
the yard. She keeps broadcasting when she occasionally goes out to
shopping with her girlfriends, and introduces the boys she occasionally
picked up before they had sex in front of the webcam. The parallel scars
on her arms and legs, she explains, were because she likes to cut
herself when she feels down. She talks with her audience members on punk
music, movies and anything that can be a subject of mundane
conversation. She also shares her intimate stories: Her first boyfriend
was black, and because she was being raised by her conservative
grandparents, and because she and her boyfriend were stupid enough to
try, they started with having only anal sex —”God, that was so
painful!”. And then, when they got caught by Grandpa together in the
shower, things became obvious. Her masturbation sessions in front of the
webcam seem more to be curious experiments to overcome the profound
boredom that she shares with her audience, than a service to them.
Excess and mundane, boredom and orgasm, friends and audience mix into
each other in *Vnmses*’ broadcasts. She does not appear as a sex worker
trying to satisfy an audience, but as a twenty-something punk seeking
satisfaction in her life with them. She never asks for tokens, but takes
them as they come, plentifully.

In the case of *Xaida*, a chaturbate.com member, who often broadcasted
in highly professional, Hollywood-grade zombie makeup and outfit during
2012, her makeup and outfit did not appear to jeopardize her ‘realness,’
but on the contrary, offered proof of authenticity: Sex workers don’t
look like zombies, and aren’t assumed to know much about the zombie
literature either, therefore sophisticated makeup and costuming
establishes the fact that the performer is a female artist seeking
erotic thrill rather than a sex worker seeking customers.

This is what I refer to ‘realness as a strategy’ as well as an effect.
As much as the female performer on the webcam can really be a
‘housewife,’ a ‘coworker,’ or a ‘bored teenager’ seeking erotic thrill,
she could be a sex worker presenting a carefully and meticulously
constructed fantasy. So, any fantasy as such that is presented with
sufficient believability, lacking any other reference, receives the
power of ‘real’ by having the effect of ‘real.’ I choose to use the term
‘realness’ in order to distinguish this form from other kinds of reality
effects. What we register as ‘real’ often appears to us as a whole,
verifiable and perpetual discursive construction, whereas the
verisimilitude of the webcam is a temporal effect sustained by its
partial and unverifiable image. Its irrefutable partiality also
distinguishes the webcam image from the ‘illusion of reality’ that is
aimed at achieving cinematic realism. ‘Illusion of reality’ in cinema is
an effect of ‘realistic fiction,’ whereas a webcam bears no script and
it is decidedly not fiction. Rather than an ‘illusion of reality,’ a
webcam, like an illusionist, inspires us to accept what it presents: it
is impossible not to believe what happens before your eyes, although
your logic tells you that a rabbit wouldn’t fit into that hat.

‘Realness’ in this sense also differs from what Baudrillard calls
simulation: simulation, in his terminology, refers to an artificially
constructed event that assumes the authority of the real, and
substitutes the real without having any reference to it. By contrast,
‘realness’ asserts an ambiguity by being partial, its verisimilitude
stems from its lack, its vagueness, in contrast with the overarching
narrative of the simulation; it doesn’t project the whole that envelopes
the present in the way Baudrillard problematizes.

‘Realness’ in this sense, resonates more with what Gilles Deleuze
describes as “virtual” at various points of his philosophical inquiries
(from his early work in Difference and Repetition, to his late works on
Cinema).[^16_Ozgun-Talking_9] Virtual, in his terminology, is not something “unreal,” or
“opposite of real,” but a “potential,” a “nebulous state” of the real
that constantly becomes “actualized.” For Deleuze, “reality” is the
outcome of the dynamic passages between the “virtual” and “actual” state
of events and things. The “actual” here, what becomes “actualized” in
the context of webcam sex, is the erotic desire. Therefore “realness” is
the “virtual” constitution of the desiring subject on/through the
webcam. With no reference to the past or the future, with no other
identifiers or discursive elements apart from (or use: beyond) the image
itself, a webcam virtually constructs and affirms the “desiring
subject,” purely within the temporality of that moment. “Realness,” the
power of the webcam to virtually construct a “desiring subject” as such,
is therefore the constitutive element of the medium, and it is directly
related with ‘live-ness.’

‘Live-ness,’ the temporality of the webcam, then, brings about a double
transgression. On the one hand, it imposes the transgression of the sex
work by blurring the markers between “desire” and “work,” and amplifies
the core erotic fantasy by unhinging it from its subordination to “sex
work.” The female performer, as non-sex-worker, ordinary woman - a
desiring subject - becomes more desirable as she fulfills the fantasy
perfectly with her “realness.” By appearing as a “desiring subject,” the
female performer fulfills the underlying fantasy, and calls for active
participation from the other party, who has to respond in kind and join
the game by generating his own desires, just like the erotic play in
physical intimacy. On the other hand, the escapist erotic fantasy itself
transgresses the banality of mundane, uneventful everyday life - as in
the case of *Vnmses*, the proper suburban girl breaking moral restraints
through immediately shared affective intensities. The seductive power of
the webcam is closely related with this two-fold transgression that
stems from indiscernibility, which becomes the definitive characteristic
of the webcam image.

## Fear and Loathing on Live Webcam Sex: The “Turkish” Case

The suspension of physical distances leads to a truly international
audience in live webcam sex channels. Yet this international audience is
divided into linguistic spheres because of the nature of
communication-—which once again shows the importance of verbal
interaction in these channels: the performances are not merely displays
of flesh, nor is the audience just a crowd of passive voyeurs; the
verbal interaction is an essential erotic component. The flag symbol
chosen by a performer for his or her profile indicates the language s/he
is comfortable speaking. Major linguistic spheres are the usual
internationally spoken languages; English, Spanish, German, Italian,
etc.

Among these international linguistic spheres, we find an unusual one, a
Turkish sphere. The presence of Turkish-speaking performers and
audiences on these channels is not surprising when we consider the size
of Turkish-speaking public worldwide.[^16_Ozgun-Talking_10] Although there is a large
Turkish-speaking immigrant population living outside of Turkey,
considering the fact that Turkish immigrants are not limited to speaking
only Turkish but have access to other, more popular linguistic spheres
(such as English or German), it is safe to presume that the
Turkish-speaking audience mainly consists of people logging in from
Turkey. The conversations within the audience also clearly confirm that
they are overwhelmingly from Turkey. But considering the circumstances
surrounding these channels, not only conservative social norms and but
also Internet regulations in Turkey, the presence of such a community
may be seen as highly unusual. Unlike in other countries that compose
other linguistic spheres, live webcam sex sites are entirely banned in
Turkey together with other pornographic and “harmful” sites. Since 2007,
the Telecommunication and Transmission Authority in Turkey has been able
to impose bans on Internet sites without prior judicial approval,
through an IP filtering system. This IP filtering system is installed on
the domain name servers and blocks access to the banned sites by
displaying a generic error page that informs the user that the website
is blocked. The nature of such Internet censorship and the controversies
surrounding the regulations are also somehow related with the
nationalist political culture that becomes crystalized in the
Turkish-speaking male audience’s interaction with female performers.

The sites that are banned by the Turkish Telecommunication and
Transmission Authority include some of the highly popular social media
sites such as YouTube, because of a particular statement in Turkish
criminal law that prohibits “insulting Turkishness.” The vagueness of
the legal term, the extra-judiciary power of the censorship authority,
and the technicalities of the IP filtering system (which does not only
censor the particular prohibited content on the sites, but blocks access
to the IP address-—to the server/site—-entirely) opened up arbitrary
censorship practices over the past years. In the face of the huge
controversy resulting from the censoring of some of the most popular
sites, Turkish Prime Minister, still not willing to ease the censorship
regulations formally, yet still trying to uphold his populist image,
famously declared: “My people know how to circumvent the censorship if
they want to, and to access to the sites they want”. So, while a huge
number of Internet sites (including the webcam sex sites) are still
banned in Turkey, various types of easily available technological
devices (such as proxy servers, IP tunneling applications or DNS
scripts) to bypass the censorship are legitimate, and are widely
deployed by Internet users on their personal computers in Turkey.

Therefore, assuming the majority of the Turkish-speaking audience on
webcam sex sites connects from within Turkey, these individuals are not
only overriding social norms regarding sexuality, but circumventing the
legal regulations related with Internet usage.

In addition, the size of this audience is unexpectedly large,
considering the circumstances. One can often see audience members with
Turkish nicknames watching performers from other linguistic spheres,
quietly enjoying the performances. There are few Turkish performers
present under the “male” category at any time of the day. But the real
size and dynamics of the Turkish audience become apparent as soon as a
Turkish-speaking female performer starts broadcasting. The
Turkish-speaking male audience immediately crowds the performer’s
channel, and the number of attendees becomes large enough to push the
ranking of the performer quickly to among the top viewed. The popularity
of any Turkish-speaking performer is so readily guaranteed that it is
possible to find female sex workers from other countries who choose to
appear under Turkish flag in order to lure the Turkish-speaking male
audience to their broadcast (which becomes a futile effort, of course,
because as soon as the audience realizes they cannot communicate with
the performer, they leave her channel).

The interaction between the Turkish-speaking performers and audience is
distinctly interesting, since it displays a quite productive paradox
between the national identity (which is a product of nationalist
fantasy) and erotic fantasy—the essential seductive power of the medium.

Quite often we find Turkish-speaking transexual sex workers performing
under the “female” category in these live webcam sex sites-—although, as
I mentioned, the sites are organized according to sexual preferences and
there is a separate section for “transexual” performers. These
performers do not hide their transsexuality or sex work, although they
do not tend to directly disclose or forefront these either-—these become
apparent very soon in the course of their performance, and go
unquestioned. The appearance of transexual performers under female
category as such does not seem to be an issue for the Turkish-speaking
male audience; on the contrary, they participate in the performance as
aware of the performers’ transsexuality and sex work, and their
interaction with the performers shows that some of the audience members
are regulars, followers, and even fans of the performers.

A similar negotiation applies to Turkish female performers. The
overwhelming majority of Turkish female performers we find on live sex
channels don't show their faces, or choose to wear a mask. A male
partner often accompanies them (who also doesn’t show his face). They do
interact with their audience, and while they play out the fantasy —of
the bored housewife, or the sexually adventurous couple—the female
performer openly demands tokens/rewards for acting out the acts her
audience demands - which sometimes include her male partner. These
performers appear to be quite familiar with sexual slang and the jargon
of sex work. The settings of the webcam show are always in a domestic
space, seldom revealing identifying markers. The interaction with the
audience almost never involves personal details or depth, and often
remains at the level of seduction-oriented small talk, or trivial
coquetry. Any details revealing hints of identity (such as a performer’s
location, her “job” etc.) appear blatantly fake - oftentimes such
details echo very common clichés of the Turkish erotic imagination: if
she is a bored housewife or secretary, she is always from lzmir, which
is an Aegean town famous in the rest of the country for its good-looking
libertine women; if she is a student, she is always from Ankara, the
capital city, which is also the home of some famous universities; if
it's a couple looking for sexual adventure, or a transsexual sex worker,
they are always from famously decadent lstanbul. All these clichés, and
the performers’ insistent demand for tokens/rewards to continue with the
show or in performing the acts her audience asks for, clearly reveal the
fact that the performance is a part of sex work. The interaction and
exchange is not intended to build up a “realistic fantasy” (or
“realness”), but function as a “protocol,” a mutually agreed convention
through which the parties declare their positions and agree on the
nature of the exchange; the common clichés presented by the performers
about themselves do not reveal anything other than reifying their
identity and their presence before the audience as sex workers. Unlike
in other linguistic spheres, the inept visibility, or direct disclosure
of sex work in Turkish linguistic sphere is not a turn-off. On the
contrary, in fact, it is almost a requirement.

Occasionally, a Turkish-speaking female performer who doesn’t observe
this mutually agreed-upon convention will appear on these channels. Her
broadcasts immediately receive the same attention as for the performers
that “play the game.” But, at the moment the Turkish-speaking male
audience members gather the clues that the performer may indeed be a
“real" housewife or a student, a “real” woman just seeking erotic thrill
by playing out a sexual fantasy or by exposing herself, or just “talking
to strangers” of the opposite sex, they respond with a particular
reaction. If the performer is not asking for “tokens,” if she seems to
be hesitant to respond to their insistent demands for showing more
flesh, or performing the acts they desire, the doubts of the audience
grow. They resist buying the idea that they are actually interacting
with a woman who is not doing sex work but just seeking erotic thrill.
The audience first starts to question the authenticity (the “realness”)
of the performer, often claiming that the performance is fake or
recorded. If the performer proves that the performance is a “live
broadcast” (by spontaneously responding to her audience’s comments), and
she confirms that she is really there talking to them, the reaction of
the audience becomes more aggressive. Their demands to see more flesh in
exchange for tokens become more insistent. If the performer continues to
ignore their demands and imposes her own will, which proves that she is
not interested in rewards, she is not a sex worker, she is just a woman
looking for erotic thrill, the tension turns into a crisis. The
“realness” of the performer in other linguistic spheres, which serves to
amplify her seductive power in this medium, is enhanced by her
disambiguating herself from sex workers; in the Turkish sphere, however,
this would function in the opposite way, with such “realness” creating a
sober repulsion in Turkish-speaking male audience members. Confronted
with proof of such “realness,” the only response left for the audience
is the denial of enjoyment through a moral reaffirmation that is
attached to the nationalist fantasy. “This woman can’t be Turkish…!” the
audience cries, “She is either Armenian, or Kurdish, or Greek perhaps?”
And before the frustrated woman finally decides to end her show, we
often see remarks about how bad this webcam is for Turkish culture, how
it corrupts the social values. “These things are not good for us!” the
Turkish speaking male audience concludes.

This pattern repeats itself almost every time a Turkish-speaking female
performer who does not seem to be a sex worker appears on live webcam
sex channels and stays long enough to build such tension among her
audience. Occasionally, some audience members may choose to voice their
opinion towards not caring about moral virtues and enjoying the
performance, but then they also receive their share of aggression, and
this time by fighting among themselves the audience makes it impossible
for them to enjoy the show.

How should we interpret this crisis, then? This pattern shows a few
things at once: First of all, it displays a patriarchal fantasy that
intends to confine female sexuality into the service of male desire; sex
work is negotiated and accepted, but feminine sexual desire that seeks
and imposes its own satisfaction is not. Then, when this patriarchal
fantasy is shattered by an insistent “realness” of the feminine desire,
the Turkish male audience responds by escaping to a larger fantasy - the
fantasy of nationalism, and reestablishes the moral ground on that
front: “She can be a real woman, but in that case she can’t be a Turkish
woman.” National identity, as imagined as it is - as a purely modern
fantasy in the case of Turkish identity - offers a last refuge for
patriarchy that female desire cannot enter and cannot lay claim to.

Because of the nature of communication and the medium, we can consider
that live webcam sex channels are open to various manifestations of
misogyny in all linguistic spheres - to the degree that other linguistic
spheres are structured through patriarchal cultural forms as well. But
the particular appearance of misogyny within the Turkish speaking
audience, that it paradoxically leads to the denial of erotic pleasure
itself, must be associated with the strength of a particular cultural
ingredient: nationalism. In the final stage of the confrontation between
misogyny and feminine desire, what glues back the shattered male ego and
opens the gates for a proud, hateful exit is a greater fantasy of
nationalism.

In any linguistic sphere, male or female, people are born with desire,
not with national identities. In the Turkish case, the nationalism that
expresses itself so schizophrenically at this moment has been cultivated
for decades in popular culture. Turkish national identity was a fiction
that enabled the foundation of modern Turkish Republic, and became an
ideal model (rather than an existing “type”) for molding its modern
social subjects. Militarism, authoritarianism, and patriarchy became
interrelated components of the political culture of “modern” Turkey, as
the previously non-existing “Turkish identity” was built by embodiment
of these notions. After 1980’s military coup, a “national culture
industry” emerged, emphasizing the same notions that are now seen in a
liberal market environment. This national and nationalist culture
industry started to dominate the local cultural markets particularly
with the emergence of private TV channels by the 1990s. Since the early
2000s, only one or two foreign films per year have broken the top 10
box-office list (from the lower ranks) in Turkey, and hybrid pop forms
produced by the Turkish music industry dominate most genres in the local
music market.

Under these circumstances, the crisis in these seedy, dimly lit internet
rendezvous houses can be seen as offering a productive tension: not only
productive for exposing and understanding the Turkish patriarchal
culture, but further offering a fertile confrontation with it.

[^16_Ozgun-Talking_10]: Now, I will refer to this particular audience as the
    “Turkish-speaking audience”, since, contrary to the assumptions of
    the nationalist fantasy I will discuss later, speaking Turkish
    language is not necessarily an indicator of “Turkish” national
    identity. Ethnic and cultural minorities in Anatolia (such as
    Kurdish people, or various non-Muslim minorities) also speak Turkish
    along with their native language, and a considerable number of
    people, such as myself, refuse to associate themselves with a
    national identity, as “Turks,” for ideological reasons. The
    problematic occurrence of the nationalist fantasy I will discuss
    later also confirms that speaking Turkish is not an indicator of
    national identity. Therefore, in this article, I will refer to this
    audience as “Turkish-speaking” with reference to language, rather
    than “Turks” or “Turkish people,” which denotes national identity.
    As the case I will discuss eventually confirms, it is a “linguistic
    sphere” rather than a “national identity.”
