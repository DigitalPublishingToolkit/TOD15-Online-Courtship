# Stranger Stranger or Lonely Lonely? Young Chinese and Dating Apps between the Locational, the Mobile and the Social

### Gabriele de Seta and Ge Zhang[^13_deSeta_Zhang_1]

## Introduction: Did You Get Married?

Just around Chinese New Year in early 2014, with most Chinese families
gathered around dining tables to celebrate the festivity, local TV
stations aired a commercial by a matchmaking company playing on the
climax of a grandmother vexing her granddaughter year after year with
the nagging half-question, “you got married, right?” (*jie hun le ba*?).
Eventually, thanks to the intercession of the sponsored matchmaking
company, the granddaughter announces to the old relative lying on a
hospital bed, “Granny, I got married!” (*waipo, wo jiehun le!*).
According to observers of online discussion boards and social networking
platforms, the reactions of the younger, marriage-aged audience to this
advertising were not the most enthusiastic – “the perception of being
held hostage by their families to get married enraged many netizens who
viewed this practice as backwards.”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_2]

Around the same time, M.G., a 36 year old single heterosexual male,
evidently still troubled about his desire for a stable relationship and
a related fraud scheme he was recently victim of, recounts his
experience with matchmaking services to one of the authors. His
narration, slightly abridged, goes like:

> Zhen Ai[^13_deSeta_Zhang_4] is a matchmaking website, and it provides not simply an
> online service for which you pay to view other people's online profile
> and contact them [...] but also a matchmaker who is a real person
> talking directly to you and sending you profiles of selected
> candidates according to the personal data you provide. I tried their
> three-month membership plan, priced at 3,000 RMB. According to the
> plan, the service guaranteed consistent efforts to introduce you to
> different women during the three months of membership. However, I
> realized that three months was a short period of time and it was
> difficult to get to know one woman, let alone many [...] so I told the
> matchmaker to be more selective. [...] I was introduced to a woman
> almost immediately, and her appearance immediately captivated me. We
> started talking on WeChat[^13_deSeta_Zhang_5] after the initial exchange through the
> matchmaker, the conversation went smoothly, and I would call her
> sometimes at night to talk to her on the phone. But we did not meet
> during the first month, so our relationship did not develop much.
> [...] Because I had to leave my hometown for a while and I felt the
> matchmaker did actually contact me very rarely, I called Zhen Ai and
> asked them if I could terminate the service and get a refund [...] and
> eventually I got part of the money back. Anyway, and here is the
> interesting part, the woman I got introduced to earlier continued to
> contact me. When our feelings escalated to a degree that I finally
> asked her to meet, she agreed at first, then suddenly declined
> claiming that she was currently not living in my hometown. After a few
> days, she contacted me saying she was at the opening ceremony of her
> new shop, and asked me if I wanted to congratulate her by sending her
> a wreath. I agreed, and she told me to call a specific flower shop and
> transfer the money to their bank account so they could take care of
> the delivery. I called the number she gave me, and they asked me 1,500
> RMB for a wreath. At this point, I had no doubt that the entire thing
> was a scam. After this episode, I didn't contact her anymore, and she
> never called me again.

In this chapter, pitched against these two frame-setting snippets about
social expectations and pressures around marriage, dating, matchmaking
and relationships in general, we would like to present some observations
regarding the use of locational social mobile applications in Mainland
China. As it is true that China has undergone two decades of accelerated
development of its communication infrastructure and IT industries,
hosting by now the largest national population of Internet users,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_6] it
is also the case that the fuzzy concept of "online dating" has
diversified into a whole spectrum of services and practices - from
traditional matchmaking intermediaries gone online to the flourishing
local ecology of social networking platforms, websites and mobile
applications: through which Chinese digital media users negotiate their
affective needs, desires and social pressures.

These developments often make the news as bits and pieces of 'the latest
weird online phenomenon in China'. We argue that there is a rift between
the isolated cries of media panics, the claims regarding the
revolutionary advent of new online platforms and the actual, everyday
life activities of hundreds of millions of Chinese digital media users:
who reinvent and deploy these arrangements of software and more or less
mobile hardware into the contingencies of their daily existence, with
little regard for, and often a cynical angle on, broad sociological
interpretations and media crazes. This is especially true in the
prurient discursive field of online dating, which often sees
commentaries on technology and media practices paired with claims
regarding sexual revolutions, degradation of morals or psychological
well-being of society at large.

Our intention is to provide a focused, in-depth snapshot of the social
practices deployed through a Chinese mobile dating application,
presented as embedded in the context of the users' everyday life. This
is a small-scale reply to certain grand sweeping statements portraying
Asia as one of the main actors of a global communications revolution[^13_deSeta_Zhang_7]
and Chinese netizen culture as the locus of a generalized sexual
rebellion.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_8] We start from the assumptions that media in general are
"a socially responsive technology"[^13_deSeta_Zhang_9] and that their situated
deployment in everyday lives is much more revealing than growing
percentages and statistics. Our hope is to give evidence, following
Stephanie Hemelryk Donald, of how mobile media in particular "allows
forms of connection and pathways of communication that are specific and
essential to the young”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_10] although we would extend this claim beyond
generational barriers and show how it is users at large, rather than a
specific age group, shape mobile media through the pathways carved by
their pragmatic and situated practices.

What we want to illustrate is how users of a popular online dating
application shape the pathways of communication of the medium through
their courtship practices. The three main sections in which we present
our analysis are named after the buzzwords that often describe these
apps – *locational*, *social*, *mobile* – and seek to question and
re-evaluate these terms in light of our findings. These three sections,
providing insights into creative usage of locative media, sociality with
strangers, and mobile self-presentation, are preceded by a
methodological note and a general discussion of our field of inquiry in
relationship to our actual site of data collection: contemporary urban
China.

## Flirting with Methods

The research presented in this chapter belongs to a tradition of
ethnographic work on the use of media and technologies, and seeks to
suggest a certain kind of situated and participative methodological
approach as the most productive way to study courtship practices on
digital media. In short, while digital ethnography has been systematized
under different names as the bundle of methods useful to collect data
about what people do on online platforms,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_11] we argue that in the case
of mobile media, with its implications of local sociality,
networking-in-transit and personal identity, an even higher degree of
participation is necessary on part of the researcher: Sheller and Urry
define this degree of ethnographic sensitivity to the use of mobile
media and social networking in everyday life "mobile ethnography".[^13_deSeta_Zhang_12]
In addition to the adoption of this sensitivity, given our focus on the
affective social practices of courtship and dating, we think it is
necessary to integrate a phenomenological component in the process of
data collection as a precious addition to participant observation,
interviews and other kinds of surveys.

In practice, the authors collected small talk, casual discussions and
more or less structured interviews of digital media users online and
offline while conducting ethnographic fieldwork in different Chinese
cities. This contextual and discursive data is complemented by a more
phenomenological, auto-ethnographic component of actual platform
experience by the authors, who have used the Momo mobile app for an
extended period of time inside Mainland China. Inspired by research such
as Jacobs's performative auto-ethnography of AdultFriendFinder users in
Hong Kong,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_13] the authors got their hands (metaphorically) dirty by
actively befriending, chatting and flirting with Momo users, playing on
different roles, genders and online personas, and (after the necessary
ethical disclosures and clearances[^13_deSeta_Zhang_14]) even meeting some of the online
contacts in real life for further discussion. To better capture the hues
and shades of how research participants shared their everyday life
through images, avatars and textual inventions on online platforms, the
authors also collected screenshots of other users' personal profiles or
image galleries, along the methodological lines of what Choi calls
“shared visual ethnography”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_15] Some of these visual materials,
opportunely anonymized, are presented as supporting evidence throughout
the chapter.

Our introduction to the research field has to be completed by a short
technical introduction to the mobile application on which we focused our
efforts. Momo (陌陌, literally "Stranger Stranger") belongs to the
category of social contact mobile applications, a kind of software
designed for smartphones and other consumer mobile devices. Features
common to this software typology include the linkage between the user
account and his/her mobile phone number, an asynchronous multimedia chat
capability, friend lists and multiple-user groups, customizable profiles
and image galleries. In the case of Momo, these functionalities revolve
around a locational search engine through which users can find and
befriend each other in function of their actual location, as mapped by
the user's mobile device GPS system and network access.

The choice of Momo as the main focus of our inquiry was mostly based on
its popularity in China during the time of fieldwork, both in media
coverage[^13_deSeta_Zhang_16] and in everyday discussions between our research
participants; in fact, the app crossed the milestone of one hundred
million registered users[^13_deSeta_Zhang_17] right in the middle of our investigation.
Creatively hailed as the “one-night stand mystical device”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_18] (*yuepao
shenqi*), Momo is often described as the best choice to “have fun with
girls” (*wan meizi / ba mei*). Yet its use is more often topic for
hearsay and speculative stigmatization rather than direct user
experiences. While much press presents the application as the “China's
sexual revolution”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_19] offering Chinese people a “path to the
forbidden”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_20] the local corporate explanations are more insightful.
Tang Yan, the CEO and founder of Beijing Momo Technology Company,
describes the app as "a more open platform" for users who have

> a lot of needs that cannot be satisfied by their current social
> networks [...] Momo provides them with unlimited possibilities and
> imaginary spaces - for example, the life[styles] that many young users
> are trying to present in their profiles are not the lives they are
> living but the lives they dream of[^13_deSeta_Zhang_21].

## Locating Mobile Sociality: Online Dating and the Chinese City

The story of affective interaction through computer-mediated
communication dates back to the early days of the medium, to the little
chronicled phenomena of mailing-list flirting, multi-user dungeon (MUD)
flings, steamy private chat-room conversations, and discussion board
romances.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_22] It is only in the late nineties, though, that attention
begins to be given to the corporate developments of online affective
practices, with commercial platforms designed specifically for the
increasing numbers of users looking at the Internet as a new opportunity
for desire and romance.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_23] As Orr recognizes, online courtship has
never been a straightforward issue, its different aspects and individual
preferences weaving "a story that was far more complex than I'd
imagined. Internet dating [...] had started changing the way in which
people socialized in some pretty profound ways”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_24] These social
shifts involved "multiple dates with different people in a single week"
and "searching on your cell phone for someone near the coffee shop you
were in", practices that were supposedly "starting to upset traditional
notions of courtship".[^13_deSeta_Zhang_25]

The efforts to understand why people prefer mediated interaction to
actual encounters have been often grounded on the larger theorization of
the media in question.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_26] It is thus under the looming presence of the
concept of cyberspace, portrayed as seductive, seemingly imaginary,
egalitarian and risky, that Ben-Ze'ev frames his question, “At any
moment, millions of people across the globe are surfing that space,
socializing with each other or having romantic affairs. The number is
growing by the minute. What is the lure of the Net?”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_27] Different
approaches have often rested on similar assumptions of a fundamental
separation between online and offline lives, and of the defective nature
of a mostly asynchronous, anonymous and textual computer-mediated
communication. In the case of online affective practices, this has led
to inquiries about the relational implications of new media and the ways
in which “online relationships substitute for, complement, conflict
with, amplify, or innovate new types of relationships”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_28]

In reviewing the relevant literature, our impression is that online
dating research has yet to catch up, methodologically and theoretically,
with leading edge of media studies in general, remaining wedded to early
debates "dominated by the image of a Gibsonian cyberspace in which users
would lose consciousness of the real world and lose themselves in a
universe of abstract forms and disembodied perspectives".[^13_deSeta_Zhang_29] It is not
surprising, for this kind of research, to espouse portrayals of online
dating as inherently positive (revolutionary or liberating) or negative
(addictive or vilifying). In opposition to this, by ditching rigid
separations between the online and the offline, and by rejecting
conceptions of technologically-mediated communication as defective or
lacking in significant ways, we postulate the embedding of digital media
into everyday life as a move towards "the contemporary debate [which]
has shifted onto the terrain of globalizations".[^13_deSeta_Zhang_30] Ten years after
Terranova's invigorating portrayal of media studies,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_31] we would take
one step forward and shift our inquiry towards the terrain of
*localizations*.

This shift is in keeping with a general "mobility turn" in the social
sciences,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_32] precious in a historical moment in which "the notion of
the city has become wedded to concepts like mobility, networks and
mediated interaction," and useful to "capture some of the new complexity
characterising contemporary urban everyday life".[^13_deSeta_Zhang_33] Our theoretical
assumption follows the idea that "the presence of GPSs (global
positioning systems), mediated surfaces, RFID (radio frequency
identification) and other technologies that all relate to contemporary
mobility practices adds a new dimension to the notion of movement and
constitutes new arenas and tools for identity-construction and social
interaction (as well, of course, for commercial exploitation and state
control)".[^13_deSeta_Zhang_34] Although we will not focus on the implications of
commerce and control, our interpretation of the “mobility turn” links
mobile technologies to identity-construction, social interaction and
locational practices. Moreover, as Jensen specifies, denouncing
accusations of isolationism and asociality, "a fair amount of these
technologies not only work as pass-time devices or artifacts that we may
'hide' behind, but they are networked and linked into the many other
layers of communication and interaction that make up the contemporary
network city".[^13_deSeta_Zhang_35]

Aiming at treating the uses of a mobile social contact application as a
node in contemporary layered urban networks, embedded in the everyday
lives of its users, and enabling individual affective practices, we
cultivate “a beginning awareness of the importance of the location, the
placement and the situated technologies”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_36] and we follow the steps of
similar endeavours in the field. For example, in her study of the use of
mobile phones use by young rural-to-urban migrant women in China, Wallis
shows how the device, integrated into socio-technical practices and
norms, provides “immobile mobility”, which she defines as “socio-techno
means of surpassing spatial, temporal, physical and structural
boundaries [...] situated in the everyday experience”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_37] while also
functioning a stabile access point to one's own (existing and potential)
social connections. Similarly, Choi propounds the idea of a city
understood as a “urban network” criss-crossed by individuals making use
of ubiquitous technologies, in which it becomes crucial to study “not
only the macro-level design of the city as a network [...] but also its
micro-level construction at the intersection of people, place and
technology”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_38]

Predictably, the theoretical arguments proposed in this section appear
familiar to Wang Li, chief operating officer of Momo Technology,
illustrates the social context of the success of his app with admirable
corporate brevity. He says,

> Over these past two years particularly, social changes have been so
> incredibly fast as people move to cities and towns [...] Chinese
> people are fairly introverted [and in a new environment] they tend not
> to make friends with their neighbours. [Moreover,] Chinese people
> didn’t have choices before and people are getting to middle age and
> realizing they don’t actually get on with their spouse, because they
> got married for reasons other than love.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_39]

## The Mobile: Self-presentation on Portable Façades

Since their inception on the Chinese market, online dating platforms had
to deal with local social mores and strategies of mediated
self-presentation. Ten years ago, Sina's vice-president Jack Hong
reportedly explained the difficulties faced by his company's dating
service in terms of ethnic and cultural factors: “Ethnic Chinese in
general have a tendency to be more passive in terms of selling
themselves [...] the result is page after page of single people who are
hard to distinguish from one another. They have answered all the
questions about their basic characteristics, but offered no additional
information. Although some people do, the majority of Chinese on Sina's
Club Love provide no photos”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_40] With the popularization of mobile
communication devices such as smartphones and tablets, often offering
personal imaging capabilities, online social platforms have become the
stage for a variety of visual self-presentation strategies that easily
disproves hypotheses of culturally rooted preferences for passivity and
anonymity.

To give some examples of how mobile social apps like Momo as used as a
portable façade for platform-specific strategies of self-presentation,
we will focus on male-female interaction, and in particular on the role
of the face and the body in this process. This choice is part of our
general orientation towards the continuity between online and offline
lives. “Rather than focusing on a ‘body less’ self online, new theories
must focus on how the body is presented in cyberspace - even if it’s not
one's ‘actual’ body”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_41] How do Momo users present their bodies to
other users, and how do they interpret other users' façades? Z.B., one
female Momo early user, explained how in her opinion the first principle
of interacting with strangers on Momo was “image management”. Other
female informants, interrogated regarding the principal criteria for
selecting among unknown guys’ contact requests, emphasized the term *kan
lian* (‘to look at the face’). Z.B. recounted of receiving ten to fifty
friend requests from (presumably nearby) strangers on Momo, and ignoring
most of them after a quick glance at their personal pictures.

To better understand this process of selection operating at the first
stages of interaction, it is necessary to go back to the workings of
Momo's messaging interface. The sender of a message can check its
successful delivery it through a colour indicator (yellow if not yet
opened, green if opened and thus supposedly read). In our experiences of
sending large numbers of friend requests to people in the vicinity, most
of our introductory messages remained forever ‘unread’: we later
understood that this was due to the “unappealing” nature of our
profiles. As a matter of fact, as Z.B. explained, our messages were
received, but the counterpart decided to ignore them without opening
them, just by a look at our personal image. “I just have to slide down
the notification bar, like this,” she shows, “and give a look at the
resized profile picture and the preview of the message. Most of the
times, I just decide based on this”. By lacking this situated knowledge
and choosing a profile picture that did not show our face, we doomed our
early attempts of initiating conversations on the platform. Moreover, by
being judged only according to the message preview, we were completely
unaware of the successful transmission of our requests - a strategy
that, in fact, functions as a perfect defence against spam and insistent
users. Being chosen among scores of other contacts does really depend on
one's face as it is encoded in a small 50x50 pixel square, in a
radicalization of classical understandings of infatuation and flirting,
according to which “face is the principal determinant in the perception
of our individual beauty or ugliness”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_42] On Momo, 'face' (as a clear,
well-framed profile picture or *touxiang* (literally 'head-image') is
the first and most important factor determining further interaction.

Besides this initial selection process, how does this *touxiang* work as
a façade? Having one is the basic requirement to hope to even get a
single, dismissive reply, but the deployment of profile pictures reveals
more subtle strategies of self-presentation that are also inextricably
linked to geographical contexts. In fact, most of the informants met on
Momo were not permanent urban residents but the sort of liminal
population floating between urban outskirts and rural areas surrounding
the city - a population that, according to Momo's CEO, makes up the
largest part of the application user base.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_43] Many of the young female
users we chatted with recalled features of the country girls moving to
the city described by Bourdieu in *The Bachelor’s Ball*: “more open to
urban ideals, and rendered particularly attentive and sensitive by all
their cultural training to gestures and attitudes, clothing and a
person’s whole demeanor, readier to deduce deep personality from
external appearance”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_44]

This impression was reinforced by the personal profiles of our contacts,
on which we observed many different examples of bodily techniques
including gestures and facial expressions belonging to the tropes of
urban fashionable women as portrayed in the media and advertising: pale
faces, long and silky hair, red and pouted lips, long lashes, cute poses
(Figure 3). These features were often paired to specific objects tied to
distinction and taste: handbags, fashionable accessories, trendy food
and drinks, items of clothing. Indeed, this does not imply uniformity of
banality, as alternative images of femininity were portrayed as well by
a segment of our informants: short hair, minimal make-up, rebellious
gestures and tomboyish looks tallying to the stereotypes of ‘progressive
urban woman’ or ‘boyish girl’ (*nühanzi*). On the whole, and quite
expectedly, Momo personal profiles were used as the “imaginary
spaces”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_45] described by Tang Yan, the company's CEO, on which users
inscribed visual experimentations enacting their dream lives rather than
just present themselves in the fashion of matchmaking services. When a
postage stamp-sized picture functions at the same time as the
determinant factor for new interactions and as a site for complicated
semiotic strategies, it is not surprising that, following Goffman's
classic theatrical framework “facial expressions [...] are generally
carefully monitored (and engineered) to preserve the desired mask”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_46]

![Figure 3](imgs/deseta-images/Figure-3.jpg)

Figure 3: Frowns, bare legs, branded drinks and fashion items linked to
situated events. "Why it doesn't snow? Please snow... \*praying hands\*"
(3.92km away) / "Rainy day, I drenched myself, if I get sick no one will
look after me..." (3.44km away).

Part of these semiotic efforts of constructing a public and social face
rely on what Bourdieu calls a "language of urban sentimentality"[^13_deSeta_Zhang_47]
which juxtaposes selfies with situated comments and referents: the place
where one is eating, one's commuting status and the vexations of traffic
and weather, all precisely localized by GPS-measured distances. This
urban sentimentality, which seems much more related to a nexus of
mobility and networked sociality than active flirtation or purposeful
romantic searches, does also rely on textual means. Usernames, short
biographies and regular status updates become another crucial site of
distinction between active members and occasional users. In this
context, the practice of posting sentimental quotes from romance novels,
rhetorical questions, complaints about boredom or loneliness, in
combination with a doctored self-shot of a frowning face or sensual
hints of body parts, described scornfully by several informants as *qiu
guan'ai* (literally ‘begging for love’), appears more as a strategy of
attention-management aimed at maintaining a façade of presence and
activity for existing and potential contacts.

In conclusion, mobility enables users of social platforms like Momo to
construct their own portable façade to be carried around everyday
movements and commutes, becoming temporarily visible to other users
intersecting paths, as “the many transit spaces of our global network
society facilitate meetings of all sorts [...] they are sites of mobile
face-to-face interaction”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_48] This “mobile face-to-face interaction”,
as mediated by Momo and similar software, is very different from
uploading one's own personal pictures on Internet websites always
visible to just about anyone. This difference might explain the success
and popularity of this sort of mobile applications offering the lure of
an “immobile mobility”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_49] a façade that functions as a site-specific
point of access for location-based, random encounters. Yet this
popularity, especially when paired with gender roles and mores, ends up
generating overloads of contact requests and competition for attention.
It is for this reason that strategies of self-presentation move away
from the obvious goals of romantic searches or flirtatious advances and
acquire a platform-specific code: optimizing one's profile picture for
attracting replies, managing one's picture gallery to represent
lifestyles and dreams, proving one's reliability and involvement in the
app through constant updates. As Figure 4 illustrates, the competition
in this attention economy stimulates the users to exploit the very
structure of the platform to prove their wit, creativity or familiarity
with the app.

## The Social: 'Stranger Stranger' or 'Lonely Lonely'?

We have hinted at how mobility reshapes social networking platforms and
the competing self-presentation strategies of their users. Yet, after
conversations initiate, what are they actually about? Is most of the
sociality between Momo users just about sexual fantasies, one-night
stands or romance, as it would seem to be implied by reports on the
“mystical tool to get laid” (*yuepao shenqi*)? From our interactions
with various informants on Momo, sexually charged conversations appeared
to be mostly disdained or deemed uninteresting, likely as another result
of gender roles and imbalances, and female users established an array of
codes and warnings to discourage straightforward approaches and rude
proposals. Besides ignoring contact requests, informants would define
these kind of vulgar conversations as boring or *wuliao* (literally
‘nothing to talk about’), emphasizing how, more than disturbed by them,
they didn't find anything interesting in them, preferring to interact
with users who provided smart dialogues, humour and (even flirtatious)
wit.

Having shown that, despite the mythology surrounding it, Momo is hardly
a 'dating app', we would rather define it as a pastime flirting
platform. Ben Ze'ev defines flirting as “a subtle, sexual communication
[...] a kind of enjoyable play having the pleasant atmosphere that is
typical of the promise of sexual activity" that yet is "not necessarily
a prelude to sexual interaction”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_50] Despite classical understandings
of the term, which define flirting as “in the main, non-verbal
behaviour”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_51] we would follow Ben Ze'ev and point out how “the crucial
element of both flirting and cyberspace" is, in fact, a kind of
non-purposive conversation similar in atmosphere to relaxed gossiping,
an "idle, relaxing, and enjoyable talk” which “involves being playful
and attaching little importance to the given subject”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_52] Informants
confirmed this broad understanding. "I once had the congenial company of
a girl. For half a month, we chatted every day until 3 a.m. We talked
about all kinds of funny things until we were both exhausted and fell
asleep laughing", recounts a male user, noting how he never actually met
his online night-chat partner. Another male informer analyses his
motivation to use Momo quite thoroughly: “On every boring holiday, every
sleepless night, I always expect to have someone from the opposite sex
feel the same around me. I just want to talk about some bullshit, not
for love, not for *yuepao* (getting laid); I just want unadulterated
chatting without constraints, under a slightly *aimei* (erotic and
ambiguous) atmosphere”.

In one of the earliest anthropological analyses of Chinese university
students' courtship practices, Moore identifies a peculiar lack of
infatuation, and finds superficial flirtatious behaviour not to be
“institutionalized in student discourse”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_53] It was regarded as a
waste of time or just plainly inappropriate. In contrast, we found the
recurrence of the terms *aimei* and *wan aimei* (‘playing / enjoying
ambiguity’) among Momo users describing their conversations on the
platform to indicate precisely a desire for establishing and maintaining
superficial, flirtatious interactions that often remain in the realm of
the digital. Moreover, the persistence and recurrence of these
conversations (“everyday”, “on every boring day”, etc.) and the
avoidance of *wuliao* interactions (the ones in which there is literally
nothing to talk about, because they are just about sex) hints at the
fact that the sociality sought by Momo users is an ambiguous one, in
constant tension between the possibility of physical contact, as
quantified by the distance between the users constantly shown in the
conversation, and the pleasure of whiling days and nights away without
the pressures of a more demanding relationship. Given the way in which
the app seems to be used not so much to find blind dates but mainly to
pass time and fight the boring spells of everyday life and transit, Momo
might literally mean 'Lonely Lonely' rather than 'Stranger Stranger', as
one user comment quips ironically, with a Chinese play on words.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_54]

## The Locational: Less Than Dating, More Than Doing Nothing

During our fieldwork, one of the authors lived in an old residential
area near a night market. He one day got in touch with N.M., a young
girl found through browsing local profiles. After ongoing conversations,
the girl invited him to join a Momo group with approximately thirty
other members, mostly shop-owners, hawkers, and sales personnel working
in the vicinity. The group description read: “Absolutely NO *yuepao*
[getting laid] (if you want to, please send each other private
messages). This group chat is only for everyday pastime chatter”. After
a while, the author was able to scroll through several pages of the
group's chat logs, observing how the recurring topics of conversation
were local issues such as: the weather, nearby food joints, and general
gossip, often discussed in a carefree and direct way, also by virtue of
the fact that group members did not know each other in real life. As
N.M. explained, she joined the group because “it is simply too *qileng*
(‘lonely and cold’) to spend the evening sitting there [in the night
market], staring at people coming and going”. What the members of this
group shared is the necessary stasis on their workplace, a cramped, yet
not prosperous night market, and the boredom resulting from nights spent
sitting among passers-by walking through their stalls in a bitterly cold
winter.

In fact, just as illustrated in the previous examples, the mobility of
devices makes this kind of sociality possible mostly in conjunction with
the locational capabilities of the GPS technology and Internet
connectivity. As Hemment explains, "the emergence of locative media
signals a convergence of geographical and data space that comes about as
soon as computing becomes mobile or ambient, reversing the trend toward
the view of digital content as placeless, only encountered in the
amorphous and other space of the Internet"[^13_deSeta_Zhang_55]. These thirty night
market hawkers, bounded by a geographical necessity, work-time and long
spells of inactivity, found a way of passing time by using the
locational capabilities of Momo to set up a local group and just keep
each other’s company. Here Wallis’ formulation of “immobile
mobility”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_56] resonates with Goffman's concept of “mobile with”:[^13_deSeta_Zhang_57] a
mobile device connected to the Internet running a locational social
platform helps users in escaping their forced immobility into a layer of
togetherness that is way more *local*-space than *cyber*-space.

Goffman's further elaboration on the concept of “mobile with” fits with
features of the night market Momo group: its components are
characterized by a “civil inattention to non-members” (N.M. happened to
ignore actual customers while replying to group messages); they maintain
a “proximity to members” (sharing both location and activities); they
develop “ritual practices for joining and departing” (the Momo group has
basic rules of conduct).[^13_deSeta_Zhang_58] Yet, quite tellingly, Goffman's original
definition of a “mobile with” – that is, “a party whose members are
perceived to be ‘together’”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_59] – does not apply to groups like the one
in question. In fact, it is precisely the mediated nature of the night
market vendors' sociality that hides their togetherness behind
apparently self-concerned interactions with digital devices. When the
author eventually took a walk through the night market, the ubiquity of
smartphones and tablets in the hands of intent shopkeepers and street
vendors suddenly hinted at a kind of sociality very different from the
recurring images of the “lonely crowds” of isolated users and alienating
technologies portrayed in popular and academic narratives.

In this last example, the locational capability of mobile devices is
repurposed a way of passing time with fellow vendors, establish a place
of encounter and a loose sense of solidarity in a sometimes boring and
unpleasant work environment that requires immobility and constant
presence. An implication of this situatedness of networked interactions
is a paradigm shift from placeless imaginations of a cyberspace
populated by interactions dislocated in place and time to actual digital
media practices embedded in everyday lives and proximal sociality. Yet,
this does not imply a 'coming back home' from Rheingold's virtual
community[^13_deSeta_Zhang_60] to the local community of the district or neighborhood.
As in the case of flirting, the locational sociality enabled by Momo
remains suspended in the ambiguity between a network of emphatic friends
sharing hours of chill and boredom in a range of a few hundred meters,
and the rarely crossed line between leisurely chatting and getting to
meet each other in person. When a group member suggested doing a meet-up
in a nearby KTV, only two people showed up, and the organizer himself
backed off in hesitation. When, after more than one month of
acquaintance, NM agreed to meet the author to get some books he promised
to give before her leaving. She was waiting there with her boyfriend, up
only for a few minutes of dismissive chit-chat before getting back to
work.

## Conclusion: If You Are (Not) the One

So reads the introduction to *Internet in One Hour: Romance and
Relationships*, one of the many guidebooks to the World Wide Web aimed
at the growing masses of users approaching the burgeoning consumer
Internet of AOL, 14.4kbps connections and Netscape browsing. Twenty
years later, in the age of 4G, social networking and locational apps,
one has to ask if romance is actually all that users want to happen in
their digitally mediated everyday lives. Is Momo really the ultimate
*yuepao shenqi*, the ‘one-night stand mythical device’ portrayed by
media narratives, welcomed by sexual revolutionaries and feared by moral
panic hustlers, if most of its users do actually use it in different
ways?

We answered this question by drawing on a digital, mobile and visually
shared ethnography of the actual arrangements of software and more or
less portable hardware embedded in the everyday lives of Momo users in
China. Following the mobility turn in social sciences, and locating the
use of ubiquitous technologies as mobile immobilities and personal
façades across layered urban networks, we had several discoveries: that
apparently trivial and narcissistic practices of self-presentation play
a pivotal semiotic role in the platform environment; that the kind of
sociality privileged on Momo is actually more about interesting
conversations than speed-dating and sexual encounters; that its
locational capabilities are exploited for local solidarities deeply
linked to layers of urbanism, work and co-presence.

Given the size of our sample (a few scores of informants), our findings
are by no means generalizable to a hundred million users. Yet, we deploy
them in order to argue against reductive conceptualizations of ‘online
dating’, ‘Internet culture’ and similar concepts that rest on dated
assumptions of a separation between online and offline lives. In the
post-digital, pervasively mediated world of ubiquitous computing, we
prefer focusing on the situated practices, platform sociality and
vernacular content appearing at the point of encounter between users and
technologies.

This theoretical stance is a powerful antidote towards determinist
explanations of media use and adoption: if Chinese users went from a
cautious preference for passivity and anonymity to an apparently
dazzling exhibitionism, this has more to do with the small-scale,
everyday media sociality than with ethnicity, culture or communication
technology in itself. Similarly, one hundred million users of a
pruriently discussed app do not necessarily imply the drastic social
changes described by media and academics: “desiring China”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_62]
“China’s hormone revolution”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_63] “people’s pornography”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_64] “China’s
sexual revolution”[^13_deSeta_Zhang_65] and other slogans have to be carefully verified
at the level of localization, since

> major studies of changes in sexual practices […] lead to much more
> moderate conclusions. Behaviours are certainly becoming more varied
> and diversified, and that reveals a growing interest in sexuality, but
> they are changing relatively slow and have little to do with the
> explosion of sexualized material in the media.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_66]

In other words, actual user practices say more about local contexts than
larger theorizations about Chinese society say about the popularity of
Momo. As a matter of fact, when embedded in the ensemble of social
expectations, peer pressure and family narratives around affects and
relationships, the snapshots presented in this chapter outline a larger
and more coherent picture. In contemporary China, where the popularity
of TV matchmaking reality shows such as *If You Are the One* (*Fei Cheng
Wu Rao*) directly reflect most parents’ involvement in their offspring’s
marriage arrangements, their disapproval of dating during school years,
and the common resort to matchmaking services. In this context,
‘flirting apps’ such as Momo provide a much needed safe haven for
relational experimentation.

To conclude, without agreeing with her portrayal of social life shifting
to “post-familial families" in which people are “alone together, each in
their own rooms, each on a networked computer or mobile device […]
spending more time with technology and less with each other”,[^13_deSeta_Zhang_67] we
believe that it is Sherry Turkle who provides one of the best summaries
of the kind of pragmatic use of technology we found and described among
Momo users in China: “people doing what they have always done: trying to
understand themselves and improve their lives by using the materials
they have at hand”.[^13_deSeta_Zhang_68] Momo is mostly not about dating, but also not
just about grooming a useless virtual persona or ‘doing nothing’ in
front of a screen. Rather, it enables a kind of *aimei* flirting along
the tensions of place, sex and identity with others who are quite not
‘the ones’ – ephemeral and proximal partners much more interesting than
the *wuliao* world of social pressures, prescribed roles, and mediated
images.
