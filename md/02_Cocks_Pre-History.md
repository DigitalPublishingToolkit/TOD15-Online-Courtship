# The Pre-History of Print and Online Dating, c. 1690-1990

### H. G Cocks

It is often argued that the rise of online dating reflects the
increasing dominance of economic liberalism in western societies. This
is said to extend even into the personal sphere where modern courtship
is epitomised by the dating website which turns its customers into
self-marketing managers of their own emotional capital. In that sense
online dating is seen to represent a particular social constituency –
the urban, late-marrying type, perhaps a member of the new white-collar
“precariat” working in professional employment on short-term contracts,
settling down much later, and as a result on the dating market for a
correspondingly longer period.

Whatever the rights and wrongs of that argument, changing patterns of
courtship (and the rise of print and later digital media to arrange it)
do reflect changes in the organisation of marriage, employment and the
relationship of self and society. Although a successful market of this
kind requires a free press and thriving print culture, in historical
terms advertising for love has become popular in conjunction with three
things: first, a mostly urban population of insecure workers seeking to
break away from established courtship patterns; secondly, the idea of
marriage as a contract freely entered into by contracting parties, and
thirdly, some kind of announced “crisis” in marriage or romantic
intimacy. The latter is normally discovered by more conservative voices,
is often part of an attack on the contractual idea, and tends to see
“modern marriage” (or partnership) as an unromantic and mercenary
transaction.

Arranging courtship or marriage via a third party is not especially
modern. Many peasant or pre-industrial societies outside Western Europe
practiced systems of arranged marriage – either via parents and close
kin, or through the offices of a professional matchmaker and still do.
In societies where production is based on the home, arranged or brokered
marriages result from the importance of the marital couple as an
economic unit, and their significance to local economic relations
involving wider kin groups. The intervention of parents and community in
the process of courtship reflected the effort to ensure that property
would be transferred legitimately and that the new household would be
able to make an effective and sustainable contribution to the economic
life of the community. In the past historians have argued that the decay
of this communal model and its replacement by one in which courtship was
almost wholly determined by the wishes of the parties concerned
reflected the emergence of free labour and capitalism. While the former
model is characterised by the intervention of parents, kin and
community, the latter is said to have been marked by the rise of
romantic love, the personal choice of partners free from parental
interference, and the establishment of a separate marital household.
This transition, from the “arranged” system that belonged more to what
is known as the “stem family” defined by broad kinship among a wide
group of relatives, to one in which romantic love and free choice of
partners is allowed has been seen as a significant moment of transition
in Western history. Most famously, Lawrence Stone argued that the
emphasis on the self and its wants over and above the needs of kinship,
alliance, or economy, beginning in the late sixteenth century,
highlighted the gradual rise of affective individualism, the decay of
communality, and hence the coming of modernity. Critics of Stone were
quick to point out that even in late-medieval texts, especially legal
codes, individual choice and romantic love could be found as an element
of marriage among all classes, and hence had to predate Stone’s
chronology. Jack Goody and Alan Macfarlane see this individualistic
model not as the creation of modernity, but of late-medieval Europe
going back as far as the late thirteenth century. For them, the fact
that canon law in medieval Europe defined marriage as an agreement of
mutual consent between the parties concerned meant that the narrow
conjugal family based on the couple, in which romantic love and not
material interest is the prime motivation, was the norm in Western
European history. [^2_Cocks_Pre-History_1]

In that sense, Stone’s critics have discounted any evidence of
intermediaries, arrangements and closely-calculated marriage settlements
that might reflect communal interest in or control over the conjugal
couple as the exception rather than the rule. However, more recent work
on northern Europe has pointed out that freedoms asserted (or legally
codified) and freedoms practised are two different things and that in
reality, most couples even in the West European marriage system had to
deal with parental and community pressures. Actual courtship was a much
more complex affair than the desiccated calculations of
rationally-choosing subjects. Moreover, community interest was often at
stake, and intermediaries were employed, even if their roles were not
formalised or professional. As Diana O’Hara has pointed out,
sixteenth-century Britain was not unfamiliar with brokers, “utterers,”
“medlers” and “matrimonial bawds” who intervened in the process of
courtship, not to mention the many aristocrats anxious over the
destination of their estates. For instance, in 1664 it was said of the
Duchess of Newcastle that “women do fee her to get them husbands, and
men to get them rich wives, so as she is become the huckster, or broker
of males and females…indeed she is a matrimonial bawd.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_2] That the
influence of these third parties on the marriage bargain was more or
less informal did not make it less important.

In northern Europe at least, the older model of communally-organised
marriage gradually gave way from the late sixteenth century onwards. In
these areas couples were expected to establish a separate household and
so in order to marry they required access to property or an artisanal
trade that would support them. However, by 1600 or so it was
increasingly difficult to ensure that new couples could support
themselves in this way, and a new category of “masterless men” or
wage-earners began to emerge. John Gillis calculates that by 1600 around
one third of the population no longer had access to land or trades, and
that as a result they became increasingly detached from traditional
customs and institutions and more willing to indulge in “private
spousals.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_3] By the early eighteenth century, Gillis calculates,
perhaps one-third of marriages were outside the purview of communal
custom. This process went hand in hand with the rise of Puritanism,
which tended to narrow the courtship process to one that focussed
primarily on the family and not the wider community. Two marriage
practices reflected these changes: first, the custom of marriage by
licence, in which the couple could (if they could afford it) pay the
local bishop to marry them without publishing the banns and therefore
attracting the interest of parents and others; and secondly, clandestine
marriages conducted in mostly urban locales known as “liberties” in
which ecclesiastical authority did not apply.

This is the historical background against which we should see the rise
of advertising for husbands and wives. Although the involvement of third
parties in courtship did not necessarily mean that families or
communities were not involved in the process, in general, we might take
the development of advertising to reflect the rise of “private spousals”
free from familial or community pressure. Advertising of this kind
emerged in the 1680s or 1690s, about forty years after the appearance of
the first newspapers. Most of these early newspapers contained small
announcements about events, crimes or incidents. One of the first
references to matrimonial advertising was from the British weekly *The
Athenian Mercury*, which in 1692 responded to a series of questions
about marriage and love with a comment on the practice.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_4] By the
mid-eighteenth century advertising for husbands, wives, and other less
conventional arrangements had a secure foothold in British print
culture.

Until the early twentieth century, the matrimonial advertisement
dominated the market. Stating an intent to marry was seen to provide at
least some guarantee of respectability. However, other less conventional
arrangements were also common in the 18th century, for instance, the
gentleman who in 1768 expressed a desire to meet a “young lady dressed
in a black nightgown, with a letter in her hand” whom he had followed
about the City the previous Friday. Others seemed to be advertising
openly for mistresses, such as the “Gentleman of independent fortune, in
possession, and very considerable expectations” who in 1770 announced an
intention to make a tour through France and Italy. He thought it would
be “a particular happiness could he meet with an agreeable young lady,
whose education and sentiments would engage his esteem and affections,
to accompany him on his travels.” Other men advertised for single women
to board with them possibly as a way of making an informal marriage.
Financial arrangements very much like prostitution were sometimes
offered by women advertisers. One 1769 ad, to “any real *gentleman*,
from a *lady* of character,” promised that in exchange for £100, a man
could have “an advantage, which cannot be named in a public newspaper.”
Another who was “at present so critically circumstanced as to want the
immediate friendship and assistance of a gentleman of honour and
benevolence,” offered in return to “render essential services.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_5]

While individual advertisements began to be common in a wide variety of
different papers, organised matrimonial agencies were also a feature of
eighteenth century society. One such agency, which presented itself as
the solution to the difficulties of modern marriage, was the
Imprejudicate Nuptial Society, or the Grand Matrimonial Intercourse
Institution, probably established in the mid-century. This organisation,
run by a clergyman from an address in the City of London, presented
itself as a philanthropic society which would enable more people to
marry, thereby saving British morals and preventing the increase of
“vagabond children.” The Rev. Watson, the proprietor, proposed to
recruit clergymen in every town who would give sermons on the benefits
of marriage, thereby collecting money which would be placed in a
communal fund for those who could not afford marriage expenses. There
would also be list of subscribers, divided into three classes according
to income and property, the estimation of which was at the heart of the
enterprise. Advertisers with the agency, such as the “Gentleman, 40 yrs
of age…a little corpulent, rather of a dark complexion, wears his own
hair,” were compelled to be honest about their status. He estimated his
wealth at £200 per annum, with £750 in the public funds, and “a small
Estate in Surry.” This method of proceeding, Rev Watson proclaimed,
avoided “the common way” which was for men to fall in love, “and then
disgracefully retreat, if there is not money enough.” In his scheme, as
in most other matrimonial ads of this period, “the circumstances are
first known, and nothing to prevent sincere love afterwards.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_6]

Allegations of fraud, which were to dog the matrimonial business for the
rest of its days, quickly followed the rise of formal marriage brokers.
In the early 1770s, a Mr R was supposed to have made a huge fortune in
London by acting as an agent for young, rich women looking to marry.
Every spring, he would place a series of ads in the press, offering to
arrange marriages for ladies with fortunes of £30,000. These wealthy
women would be installed at his house, while he again advertised for
potential suitors, who, it was said, paid him as much as £500 for the
privilege of paying court to his clients. He was then supposed to have
“touched several five hundreds without the candidates for matrimony
being successful,” and kept everybody dangling on a string while he
pocketed the proceeds.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_7] However, rumours like this did not dent the
popularity of the medium, and by 1777, a young lady could aver that “the
mode of advertising is become too general.” However, she herself was not
deterred from seeking “a man of fashion, honour, and sentiment, blended
with good nature, and a noble spirit, such a one she would chuse for her
guardian and protector.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_8]

The feeling expressed by one advertiser in 1749 that “the mode of
advertising… may be looked upon with disdain and contempt by some,” was
not mitigated by its association with some unsavoury episodes.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_9]
Suspicions about the type of man who might advertise were compounded by
one of the most famous crimes in British history, the murder of Maria
Marten by her sweetheart William Corder at the infamous Red Barn in the
village of Polstead in Suffolk in 1827. Part of the sensation that
surrounded the trial of Corder in 1828 was the revelation that he had
been a regular user of matrimonial columns. In that sense, the case
offers a rare glimpse into the style of advertising in this period. In
the winter of 1827, fleeing his crime which was still undetected, Corder
moved to a tavern in the City of London, from where he took out ads in
the *Morning Herald* and *Sunday Times*. His announcement, headed
“MATRIMONY,” described him as a “A Private Gentleman, aged 25, entirely
independent,” seeking “any female of respectability, who would study for
domestic comfort,” and who was willing “to confide her future happiness
in one every way qualified to render the marriage state desirable.” He
was, the ad said, a “sociable, tender, kind, and sympathising
companion,” and instructed correspondents to write to Mr Foster’s
stationer’s shop in the City, from where he would collect the letters.
More than fifty replies came in from women mostly in their late teens
and early twenties, and still more women came to Foster’s shop – later
luridly described in the press as a “*Love Depot*” – to inquire after
the advertiser’s character. The means of getting to know advertisers
like Corder varied widely. Some respondents offered to pair him with
their sisters, others did not want to meet him but preferred to get to
know him first by an extended correspondence, and some wanted to arrange
an interview at their homes. One reply instructed Corder to take a walk
on the south side of Northampton Square in the City of London, between
the hours of 12 and 1 on the following Monday, and to carry a white
pocket-handkerchief. “I shall be there and may perhaps have an interview
with you,” the writer promised.

Corder eventually made the acquaintance of one Mary Moore and, with his
past still completely unknown, offered the promise of marriage. Ms
Moore’s mother was set against such a proceeding, mainly because the
anonymity of the ad did not allow them to know or investigate Corder’s
family connections. Her brother was also suspicious of this man who had
appeared apparently from nowhere, and angrily denounced the whole
business. However, as Miss Moore pointed out to him, the matrimonial ad
was for financially independent individuals like herself who did not
have to put up with the interference of their families. Most of Corder’s
respondents were the same – they were young women who were distanced
from parental interference, either through the death of parents or
relatives, or through their own financial independence. Miss Moore, who
had inherited some of her father’s wealth, was one of many such women.
She told her brother “that she was fully satisfied in her own mind,”
about Corder’s connections, “and urged that as she was her own mistress,
she should use her own discretion, and in defiance of anything her
brother might urge to the contrary, she should marry him on the
morrow.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_10] She carried out her threat, and she and Corder moved to
Ealing in West London to open a girls’ boarding school, living in what
appeared to be marital bliss right up the moment when her husband was
arrested in the spring of 1828 for the murder of Maria Marten.

Most observers agreed that Corder’s career after the murder showed him
to be the exact epitome of a “cool, calculating, deliberate villain.”
One of the key lessons of the tale, played out in the countless shows,
songs and plays which followed the trial and played continuously
throughout the following century, was never to trust a man who
advertised for a wife. Mainly, though, it was suggested that the case
should act as a warning against the kind of independence shown by Mary
Moore.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_11]

Cases like these may have put off respectable middle class readers and
helped to confine the appeal of matrimonial advertisements to the
working class. When a new craze for it reappeared in the new penny press
of London in the 1860s, in titles like the *London Journal*, *Family
Herald* or the *Halfpenny Paper*, it was certainly felt by most editors
that the practice belonged almost wholly to the less educated working
classes. However, although it was regarded as far from respectable, by
1900 the matrimonial press in Britain at least had developed into a
particular form of journalism. This was in marked contrast to the
European continent, where most mainstream newspapers like the
*Frankfurter Zeitung* included extensive sections of matrimonial
advertising as a means of financing their news coverage.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_12] In
Britain, respectable papers like the *Times* or *Morning Chronicle*
refused to carry matrimonial ads, thereby encouraging the development of
a specialist press devoted solely to publishing them.

As a consequence of this ban a specialised matrimonial press began to
flourish in late-nineteenth century Britain. The British Library lists
twenty-two matrimonial papers established between 1870 and 1914, while
several other titles also contained matrimonial columns around this
time. Most of the dedicated matrimonial press was allied to a related
agency where advertisers could obtain the personal services of a
matrimonial agent.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_13] Of these titles some were more long-lived than
others. Among them were the *Matrimonial News and Special Advertiser*
which claimed to date from 1848 (though wound up in 1895), the
*Internationale Matrimonial Gazette* of Sheffield, which in various
guises ran from 1909 to 1944, and the most venerable of the British
papers, the *Matrimonial Post and Fashionable Marriage Advertiser*,
published in Bristol, which claimed lineage from 1860 and was run by the
same man – R. Charlesworth – between 1894 and 1948. Some other titles
appear to have lasted only a few months. Most of the papers were based
in London, though several existed in provincial cities. The larger
papers carried between 200 and 600 ads, though several of these would
have been reinsertions over several issues. In addition to this
dedicated press, there were many others, ranging from W. T. Stead’s high
class matrimonial monthly the *Round About* (1898-1903), to the comic
paper *Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday*, or the fiction series *My Pocket
Novels* (1900-1934) that carried matrimonial ads or operated agencies by
post at various times in the same period.

These papers appealed to, and were mainly used, by two main social
groups: white collar workers such as clerks, and the upper working class
– tradesmen and domestic servants. Advertising rates were generally kept
low – in the 1890s matrimonial papers cost around 3d, while advertising
costs were around 1 shilling for between 20 and 50 words, depending on
the paper. Personal interviews with the editor/agent cost around 5
shillings. Further costs could be incurred on marriage. In 1893, for
instance, one advertiser was asked for £10 up front and then two and a
half per cent of any marriage settlement.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_14]

These practices were revealed by the trial of the Skates brothers,
proprietors of the World’s Great Marriage Association (and the
*Matrimonial Herald*) in 1895. The case resulted from the fact that in
order to keep unsuccessful (and unappealing) male suitors on their books
they had sent out form letters to a few advertisers from ladies that did
not exist. The agency profited mainly from its personal services, for
instance, charging some clients between £2 and £17 for such assistance
in the marriage market, including personal interviews, advice and
introductions. The trial also revealed the social constituency of
matrimonial papers and agencies at this time. Its male clients were
mainly shopkeepers and skilled workers, such as tobacconists, tailors,
hairdressers, decorators, printers and other “well to do artisans,”
while its female ones were mostly domestic servants and some widows with
capital.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_15]

It was widely held at the time that the matrimonial press provided a
useful service to the generally impoverished white collar worker, who,
uncertain of his income and status, could find respectability helpfully
quantified by the requirement of most papers for the advertiser to state
his or her income. Matrimonial ads were also seen as a response to the
“surplus woman” problem that emerged from a gender imbalance in
Britain’s population from the 1860s onwards. Another factor that
assisted the rise of the matrimonial press was the increasingly popular
idea of marriage as a type of negotiable contract. This view had emerged
in the mid-nineteenth century in Britain as part of the attempt to
reform the laws governing divorce and married women’s right to property.
By the end of the century marriage-as-contract had a number of powerful
feminist advocates including the writers Mona Caird and Cicely Hamilton,
the latter the author of the 1909 protest against *Marriage as a Trade*.
The contractual idea appealed to feminists as it seemed to allow women
to circumvent the suffocating restrictions of class, custom and family
that dictated who and how a woman should marry. It also appeared to
undermine the idea of patriarchal authority within marriage by
suggesting that both parties met on the basis of equality. These ideas
were accompanied by a widespread feeling that modern love had
degenerated into a merely pragmatic and often monetary relation.

Caird had become famous in 1888 when an article by her in the London
*Daily Telegraph* entitled “Is Marriage a Failure?” caused a national
sensation. In the years following, Caird promoted the idea that marriage
should evolve from primitive practices towards contractual agreement.
She argued that science, and especially Charles Darwin, had shown that
marriage had begun in savage practices like wife-capture, and the
problem was that it continued in much the same coercive form. To break
away from the “barbaric” elements of marital coercion, men and women
should, Caird argued, “*form their own contract*, and not be forced to
accept one whose terms they have had no voice in deciding.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_16] The
problem then was how to invent a place where such contractual ideas
could be put into practice. For an answer many progressive thinkers
turned to the matrimonial advertisement and agency. Advocates of
eugenically-influenced “rational reproduction” adopted it as a way round
the “dsygenic” courtship practices associated with the rituals of
respectability that prevented healthy men and women marrying across
class boundaries, while others, such as the pioneering editor W. T.
Stead established their own version of a social network. Stead’s idea,
which ran from 1898 to 1903, was called the Round-About, and was
modelled on a matrimonial agency but with the important difference that
clients did not have to state a “matrimonial intention,” and could
therefore interact without the anxiety thereby imposed. Men and women
would see their ads in the Round-About newspaper, and then write to each
other via a central office of the “Controller” where profiles of
themselves were also kept. If the profile took your fancy, a
correspondence would follow and if so inclined, marriage might result.
This, Stead argued, was a key solution to the problem of modern urban
alienation that especially afflicted the young white collar or
professional worker living in what he called “the City of Dreadful
Solitude.” Others also took up the matrimonial bureau as a philanthropic
idea and rational solution to modern problems, including the founder of
the Salvation Army, William Booth. He envisaged a “colony scheme” – a
gigantic programme for exporting Britain’s urban poor to Canada and
Australia, part of which would be a matrimonial agency ensuring that
healthy marriages were made.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_17]

Even though all these efforts gained national attention, they were never
as commercially successful as the established matrimonial industry.
However, in 1913 a new form of advertising appeared on the British scene
in the literary periodical *T. P.’s Weekly*, named after its founder the
Irish politician Thomas Power O’Connor. In its “Friends in Council”
column, *T. P.’s Weekly* allowed advertisers to solve the problem of
modern solitude by searching for friends and “companions,” without
stating any matrimonial intent. The respectability of the column was –
at first at least – protected by the fact that all those seeking such
friends had to provide two letters of reference, one of which had to be
provided by a clergyman. Similarly, suggestive self-descriptions such as
“unconventional” or “bohemian” were banned. By 1915 Friends in Council
had processed over 8,000 ads at a rate of five to six hundred a week and
had started a national trend.

The origins of lonely hearts ads, as opposed to matrimonial ones, can be
found here, and also in the craze for advertising that sprung up during
World War One to cater for servicemen. From the outbreak of the war in
1914 it became something of a national duty to write to those serving in
the armed forces and several newspapers in Britain opened schemes that
organised the sending of parcels and care packages to the various
theatres of the war. In France this sort of correspondence was
officially sponsored, and French women could become “*marraines de
guerre*” (godmothers of war) in order to exchange letters with
*filleuls* (adopted sons) in need of epistolary companionship. In
Britain, this form of letter-writing operated in a less formal sense
through the columns of papers like *T. P.’s Weekly* and other
periodicals where “lonely soldiers” and their admirers of both sexes
could advertise for pen-pals or other types of companionship. The volume
of this correspondence could be readily estimated from the complaints
made by the British Army’s postal service about its size and potential
for disrupting military logistics. In February 1915 it was pointed out
that one ad, which ran for a few issues of the *Daily Chronicle*, and
had been placed by a driver in the artillery, had generated three sacks
of mail, one containing 3,000 letters, plus 98 parcels.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_18] The lonely
soldier craze reached a peak in the summer of 1916 when the newspaper
*Pearson’s Weekly* ran a competition for servicemen, the prize for which
was a chance to woo the soldiers’ pin-up and theatre star Phyllis
Monkman. By that time though, the authorities had lost their patience
and after a while they forced the paper to abandon the scheme.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_19]

The success of the lonely soldier movement encouraged others to enter
the wartime market, not least the *Link*, the first periodical in
Britain wholly devoted to the publication of “companionship” ads. The
*Link* (which was originally given the more enticing name *Cupid’s
Messenger*) was founded in 1915 by the career journalist and comic
novelist Alfred Barrett (a former editor of the *Family Circle* and
*Woman’s World*), and its masthead firmly stated that it was a “Great
Social Medium – Not Matrimonial.” The *Link* cost 8d, though advertising
was only 1d per word, and it sold around 5-6,000 per issue. However,
along with the contemporaneous lonely soldier movement and the other
papers such as the racy bachelor periodical *London Life*, which were
also opening their own “friendship” columns, the *Link* seemed to
represent to many commentators the leading edge of modernity, bad and
good. Before long, the *Link’s* announced non-matrimonial intent, not to
mention its clientele of “sporty” and “unconventional” female
advertisers, began to attract the attention of moral campaigners and the
police, who tended to view it as morally dangerous, if not a medium for
open prostitution. Stories of girls disappearing into white slavery
through its columns began to circulate in the more sensational
newspapers, and the police began to take a keener interest. Although
they discovered very little evidence of prostitution by women, the
authorities did uncover a series of ads that appeared to be arranging
contacts between gay men, and which were therefore more obviously
illegal. In their ads, these men commonly cited a canon of homosexual
heroes, from Hercules and Iolaus to Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde,
declared themselves “theatrical,” “musical,” and “sincere,” before
announcing a willingness to meet a potential friend or chum, “own sex.”
In 1921, a police investigation of these ads, and a discovery of a cache
of intimate letters between two men who had met through the *Link*,
landed the paper, its proprietor Alfred Barrett, and three advertisers
in court. They were all charged with procuring and inciting “acts of
gross indecency” and all sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard
labour.

That episode put an end to the wartime craze for companions and friends,
and seemed to confirm once again the low reputation of such enterprises.
However, the matrimonial industry, which had generally held itself aloof
from the fashion for companionship, continued unperturbed through the
interwar period, though it was still associated with an unfashionable
lower-middle and working class clientele. The *Link* case contributed to
an atmosphere of distrust that prevented any more “lonely hearts” or
companionship ads appearing in the legitimate matrimonial press. Other
papers that had followed the *Link* and *T. P.’s Weekly* into the trend
dropped their columns after the trial. After 1921 the requirement to
state a matrimonial intent was restored to its dominance and it was not
really until the 1960s that the dubious status of the lonely hearts ad
ended. Correspondence clubs such as the longest-lasting one, the
Universal (established in 1916 and still in existence in the 1940s)
continued to exist, and others grew up at the end of World War Two to
cater for a newly-perceived epidemic of solitude and a short-lived
post-war boom in divorce (that peaked in 1948 and soon fell away to
almost nothing in the 1950s). However, these “friendship” organisations,
such as the Victory Correspondence Club or the Two-Ways Correspondence
Club, remained on a small scale and most were run by an odd collection
of ex-military men from their homes in provincial towns and seaside
resorts.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_20] Marriage bureaux also enjoyed a new vogue in this climate,
some of which began to use psychological and psychoanalytical profiles
in order to match people.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_21] Responding to the apparent crisis in
marriage that seemed to overcome British society in the 1940s, some
observers even argued that such organisations should be a
state-sponsored element of the new welfare state which grew up under the
post-war Labour government.

Even in the 1960s, when the matrimonial industry had produced new
“scientific” offshoots such as Dateline, founded in 1966 to match
partners using computer analysis, the authorities still suspected the
intentions of many advertisers and editors. This became obvious as part
of the backlash against the counterculture at the end of the 1960s when
the police repeatedly attempted to prosecute the hippy paper
*International Times* (more often known as *IT*) for “corrupting public
morals,” one of the crimes supposedly perpetrated by the *Link* in 1921.
This charge was a sort of legal catch-all usually directed against the
organisation of prostitution through advertising or publicity of various
kinds – it had also been used in 1960 against a list of call-girl
contacts known as the *Ladies’ Directory*. *IT* got into trouble for the
same reason as the *Link*: publishing gay contact ads. Even though
homosexuality between men was decriminalised in Britain in 1967 (as long
as it remained in private and only two people over 21 were present), the
police decided in 1969 that *IT* should be prosecuted and a
long-drawn-out series of trials and appeals began that lasted until the
paper was finally convicted in 1972. The whole process was part of a
pattern of prosecutions against countercultural magazines for obscenity
– the most famous being the case against *Oz* magazine in 1971, which
resulted in long prison terms (overturned on appeal) for its editors.

The *IT* trial ended up making the efforts of the police look rather
ridiculous however. Their attempts to clamp down on ads that sought to
facilitate a wholly legal activity (gay men over 21 meeting each other)
along with the lengthy process of appeal, ensured that the case (with
many others like it) was widely ridiculed.[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_22] The revelations that
followed a few years later of extensive police corruption in London’s
Obscene Publications Squad, the branch that masterminded the whole
operation, further dented the credibility of such efforts. Moreover, the
small ad (in its various forms) was a key technology of the
counterculture, which had popularised its use in freesheets and
magazines as a method of organising political and cultural groups. Its
widespread use in these forms, as well as to facilitate straight lonely
hearts and the contacts of gay men, made it unlikely that any further
attacks on the latter would be successful. This was especially true
since following the emergence of gay liberation at the end of the 1960s,
there was an explosion of gay magazines like *Jeffrey* (est. 1972) that
made extensive use of “Photo Pen Pals,” and “Jeffrey’s Beautiful Butch
Little Ads.”[^2_Cocks_Pre-History_23] Once these forms of contact had been pioneered, and
their legality tested by the gay press and the counterculture, it was
far safer in the 1970s for anyone to advertise in any way they wanted,
for partners, group sex, or even for old-fashioned relationships.

Advertising for love has made halting progress towards respectability in
the previous three centuries. Its rise in the 18^th^ century reflected
the long gradual breakdown of early-modern courtship rituals and marital
practices, and it has subsequently appealed to (among others) people
experiencing the “dreadful solitude” of the modern city, those
contesting traditional heterosexuality and its rituals, and those at the
edges of conventional morality like gay people and the counterculture.
For much of its history, advertising for love was usually done in the
context of a marital intention, and most advertising was contained in
papers strictly devoted to finding husbands and wives. The clientele of
these papers, which mainly came from the lower-middle or upper working
class, tended to ensure that matrimonial advertising remained on the
other side of respectability. It was only in the early 20^th^ century,
with the dislocations of war, that a new style of “companionship”
emerged, one that has since come to dominate digital technologies.
