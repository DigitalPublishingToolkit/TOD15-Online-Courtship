Abstract: Computer mediated interpersonal interactions are defining our daily lives as we know it. Studying this phenomenon with various methodologies, across different cultures and traditions is a crucial component in understanding social ties. This book brings together articles that approach online dating from a  range of cultural and critical perspectives. 
The research decodes the approach to online dating in various countries like France, India, China, Turkey, Cuba, USA and Portugal. Mapping the history of dating and courtship shows the evolution of these practices even before the introduction of the online medium and traces parallels and differences between old and new traditions.

# Keeping it Unreal - Online Dating with Chinese Characteristics


### Yann-Ling Chin

The success of *The First Intimate Contact*, a novel written by
Taiwanese student Cai Zhiheng in 1998, created a frenzy about online
romance in China. Many envisaged the romantic experience of meeting a
loved one online just as depicted in the novel. Though the hype
surrounding online romance may have dissipated, the practice has
certainly not gone out of fashion. As the country with the largest
Internet population in the world, dating somebody online has become
a mainstream mode of courtship for many Chinese, similar to Internet
users in the West. In fact, existing studies suggest that Chinese
Internet users embrace social media more extensively than their Western
counterparts. For example, according to business consultant group, BCG’s
press release dated 12 April 2012, 79 percent of Chinese used instant
messages (IM) compared with 21 percent of U.S. Internet users.[^15_Chin_1] *Sina
Weibo*, the most popular microblogging service provider boasted 300
million registered users by the end of 2011 in less than three years of
operation,[^15_Chin_2] compared with Twitter which has operated since 2006 and
is reported to have 100 million users as of September 2011.[^15_Chin_3] The
results of an online survey involving Chinese and American youths showed
that the Internet was much more appreciated in China than in
America.[^15_Chin_4] For instance, 77 percent of the 1,104 Chinese participants
agreed with the statement “the Internet helps me make friends”, compared
to only 30 percent of the 1,079 American participants. The study also
showed that 66 percent of the Chinese surveyed thought that online
interactions had broadened their sense of identity only 26 percent of
American respondents reported to have this benefit.

Yet despite China’s exponential growth of its Internet population and
enthusiastic embrace of social media, our understandings of online
relationships are mostly limited to studies based in the Western
context. The development of the information and communication (ICT)
industry in China is even more astounding if we take into the
consideration of stringent state control, monitoring and information
censorship. My research into China’s online dating scene has revealed
culturally unique understandings and practices of online romance,
reflecting the impact of the country’s on-going socio-cultural
transformations.

Since the economic reforms in the late 1970s, the state loosened it
controls on labor, capital and commodities markets to stimulate growth.
Individuals were liberated not only to pursue their own economic
activities, but also to reclaim their private life from the control of
the party-state and parental authority. The new culture of courtship and
marriage that emerged as a result of state sponsored structural changes
emphasizing freedom of love and material comfort is at odds with the old
ideal of romantic love founded on feelings and emotional
satisfaction.[^15_Chin_5] The relentless pursuit of materialism and economic
growth has rendered many feeling bewildered and with a strong sense of
emotional emptiness. My study shows that many Chinese are increasingly
turning to relationships online to satisfy their unfulfilled emotional
needs.

The following discussion is based on the findings of my online
participant observations in *Love Apartment*, a relationship site,
*Renren*, China’s equivalent of Facebook, and the *Tianya* bulletin
board system. The online participant observations took place for 10
months beginning from May 2009. Love Apartment was chosen because of its
unique game-like appeal.[^15_Chin_6] *Renren* is the ideal site to observe the
online interactions of Chinese Internet users, especially among
students. Tianya has several discussion forums dedicated to
relationships, including online romance. This is where personal stories
of online romance, concerns, problems encountered, and others’ opinions
towards online romance can be heard and shared. For ethical reasons, my
identity as a researcher was made explicit in my profile on these sites
and was stated upfront to all users with whom I came into contact. The
analysis of participants’ views on online romance suggested that there
were three ways in which Chinese Internet users conceptualized online
romance. I referred to the three categories as ‘pragmatic fantasists’,
‘romantic realists’ and ‘sceptics’, each holding different attitudes
towards online romance. Participants’ quotes in my discussion are
credited to the authors’ user names on the site. I also relied on my
participants’ narratives of their online romance to elucidate these
categories and how their different experiences demonstrated the diverse
social potentials of online romance.

All data collected were originally in Chinese. My role as both
researcher and translator may have ensured greater transparency and
consistency, but translation is more than a technical issue of
transferring meanings from one language to another. Translation
decisions have epistemological and ontological implications.[^15_Chin_7] My
translation added another layer of meanings, despite my desire to
feature participants’ own voices more prominently and allow readers an
active role in interpreting the original messages. Following Birbili’s
advice, to best represent participants’ words, in my translation, the
structure, tone and style of participants are preserved as closely as
possible, but not to the extent where word-by-word translation would
seriously invalidate English grammar and risk distorting the meanings
and undermining readability.[^15_Chin_8] In other words, minor grammatical error
is tolerated and since I prioritize semantic equivalence over structure,
I occasionally rearrange sentence sequence if it helps to better convey
participants’ meanings in English.

In this chapter, I will also introduce ‘Platonic emotional love’ and
‘play’, the two keywords in Chinese discourse of online romance. I will
examine the theoretical underpinnings of these two words and how they
relate to the three categories. This chapter begins by exploring the
meanings of online romance in China. My study shows that there is a
conceptual ambiguity associated with the term ‘online romance’ and this
has resulted in confusion among Chinese Internet users.

## Meanings of *Wanglian* (Online Romance)

Although the term *wanglian* is frequently used, its precise meaning
varies and contains ambiguity to all Chinese. Some of my participants
referred it to romantic relationships initiated online and gradually
expanded into the offline world, maybe even cumulating into long-term
relationships or marriage. But substantial numbers of Chinese Internet
users also understand online romance as the act of romancing online, or
referring to exclusively Internet-based relationships. By definition,
*wang* means net and *lian* refers to love. Online romance would,
indeed, imply romantic relationships happening and confined within
cyberspace. Some users were confused. For instance, Zhang Caiyuan wrote
on the forum at *Renren*,

> I think I have a misconception of online romance. Online romance is a
> romantic relationship taking place online without any offline
> interactions. I met her online, but our relationship developed in the
> offline world, I think strictly speaking, it cannot be categorized as
> online romance. This is a very ambiguous concept.

Similarly, when discussing if online romance could become an offline
reality at *Tianya* forum, Jipingliuer replied that “I think online
romance is not the same as turning an online acquaintance into a
courtship partner.” The answer suggests that the user thinks the two are
different romantic experiences that should not be conflated. Other
nuanced differences that cause confusion include whether online romance
applies to romantic relationships that developed only after face-to-face
meetings, and amorous affiliations developed online between partners who
were first introduced by an offline friend. For example,

> I met my current partner through a colleague’s recommendation. We
> first contacted each other online and because of the distance, we rely
> on the Internet to keep in touch. I am not sure whether this counts as
> online romance or not (Nakai).

In short, *wanglian* does not denote a single homogeneous type of
computer-mediated relationship. Its contestable meanings have led to
different implications depending on the way the term is used.

For the purpose of this study, I will focus on the two main types of
online romance as defined by a Chinese scholar in his theoretical
discussion of online romance.[^15_Chin_9] The first is romantic relationships
that exist exclusively online in which couples refrain from having any
offline contacts with each other. The second is relationships that rely
on the Internet merely as a tool for communication in which couples
first meet online but gradually expand their relationship into the
offline world. These relationships are ultimately not very much
different from conventional courtship. A similar definition was also
used in research of online romance involving 4,811 students across nine
provinces in China.[^15_Chin_10] In the report, online romance is defined as
Internet initiated relationships that flourish into romantic bonds,
remaining either exclusively online or materializing into the offline
world. The definition provided in Chinese literature nevertheless seems
to emphasize the presence of romantic sentiment prior to any offline
interactions. In other words, in the Chinese definition, couples that
meet online but only become romantically involved after meeting in
person and spending time together offline would not be considered as
online romance.

The definition of online romance in China intrigues me because Western
literature on online romantic relationships is concerned mostly with
only the second type. For instance, Merkle and Richardson highlighted
how online relationships develop through an inverted sequence that
eventually leads to face-to-face meetings;[^15_Chin_11] McKenna, Green and
Gleason conducted a path analysis to explore the sequence of moving
online relationships offline;[^15_Chin_12] Baker defined successful online
relationships as those that cumulate into long-term courtship,
cohabitation or marriage in the actual world.[^15_Chin_13] I once came across a
personal advertisement in a *Tianya* online romance forum, dated 15
September 2009, from a male aged 22, specifying that he was looking for
a strictly online romantic relationship, precluding any face-to-face
interactions. This may seem almost inconceivable in the West, but is
rather common among Chinese Internet users. An online survey involving
Chinese and American youths showed that 61 percent of the former said
they had a parallel life online, compared to only 13 percent of the
latter. In fact, 63 percent of Chinese participants agreed with the
statement that “it is perfectly possible to have real relationships
purely online with no face-to-face contact” compared to only 21 percent
of Americans.[^15_Chin_14] Chinese Internet users’ tendency to demarcate the
online and the offline world, and their motivations for doing so,
appeared to me as a culturally distinct phenomenon.

This is not to say that exclusively Internet-based relationships do not
exist in the West, or all Western online daters desire to move their
relationship offline, it does, however, show that this type of
relationship is not on top of Western scholars’ agenda, presumably
because it is perceived, rightly or wrongly, to be insignificant or
impossible. For example, Ben-Ze’ev argues that ‘profound online only
romantic relationships’ are transitional and unsustainable because
without embodied interactions offline, these relationships are
incomplete.[^15_Chin_15] His underlying assumption is that people typically want
to expand the relationship offline, but this does not apply to all
Chinese Internet users as some of them make their choice to confine
their romantic liaisons online. The ‘incompleteness’ is actually
desirable for them, because by confining it within cyberspace, the
effectiveness of the relationship to fulfil couples’ emotional needs is
enhanced, yet without creating many complications in their everyday
life. This group of individuals is what I referred to as ‘pragmatist
fantasists’, who tend to understand online romance as a kind of
‘Platonic emotional love’. To fully understand the motivations of
pragmatist fantasists, we need to first examine the notion of Platonic
emotional love as used in the context of Chinese online discourse.

## Platonic Emotional Love

‘Platonic love’ is often used interchangeably, or sometimes together,
with ‘emotional love’ to refer to exclusively Internet-based romantic
relationships with a strong emphasis on emotional gratification. During
my participant observations, I regularly came across participants
talking about how online romance could provide emotional solace
(*jingshen weiji*) to lovers that would help to rejuvenate their
worn-out self.

> Online romance, even if you can’t be together, you can, at least,
> enjoy the illusionary quality, the purest emotional love. Even if
> heartbreaking, it is still a wonderful and unforgettable [experience]
> (Luohuarumeng).
>
> Most people’s everyday life is full of regrets and adversities, and
> the dull daily routine makes everyone crave for excitement. In the
> real world, too many worries and inhibitions make it difficult to
> relieve tension. The Internet can satisfy these needs and stir
> people’s imagination. Albeit just virtually, it is a way to relieve
> tension. People can then get on with their study or work when back to
> the real world. Online romance is the emotional supplement [that
> invigorates] the everyday life (Jimogaoshou).
>
> Life is full of frustrations. Unable to find what you wish for in real
> life, then the Internet is the best you can count on… Nothing wrong
> with going online to unwind and readjust your emotion. So moderate
> online romance is actually good [for the individuals] (Xueshangfeier).

The last two arguments are underpinned by a utilitarian attitude to
strategically make use of online romance to promote lovers’
psychological wellbeing. It reflects the pervasive therapeutic ethos of
contemporary society, in which emotional life, as pointed out by Illouz,
is “in need of management and control and on regulating it under the
incessantly expanding ideal of health.”[^15_Chin_16] Achieving emotional
competence, “namely self-awareness, the ability to identify their
feelings, talk about them, empathize with each other’s position and find
solutions to a problem”, becomes imperative to success in both public
and private lives.[^15_Chin_17] Online relationships are particularly good at
helping participants to develop their emotional competence as the
performance of intimacy online relies on constant verbalization and
exchange of private inner feelings. Nevertheless, not all online daters
are content with mere emotional interactions, yet their physical
separation makes regular corporeal interactions difficult.

> The warmest of online love you can hope for is in the form of text, at
> best the voice of the lover. When in trouble or feeling upset,
> emotional support is what you can get … there isn’t a shoulder for you
> to lean on … no open arms to comfort you. When you needed him/her the
> most, you might not be able to get hold of him/her, like a loose kite
> flying on the sky… (Fanfan).

Describing online romance as largely an emotional affair excluding
actual bodily interaction coincides with the way some Chinese Internet
users understand online romance as romancing exclusively online.
Although the relationship can be extended to the offline world, ideally,
it should be confined within cyberspace for safety, moral and practical
reasons.

> Online romance should only be online. It cannot be extended to real
> life. The Internet is a virtual world, people you meet online are not
> the same person offline. You can’t be sure of his/her character, life
> or family circumstances. Therefore, it is alright to have online
> romance, but you can’t transfer the relationship offline
> (Hongsexianrenqiu).
>
> In cyberspace, emotions become even more crucial. Social interactions
> seem much purer. Romancing online, everything turns illusory yet
> wonderful, like a fairy, untouched by worldly concerns… If everything
> stopped here, it would be fabulous (Stefanie).
>
> Online romance is largely about emotional solace; it brings emotional
> support and happiness but when the relationship grows deeper and
> becomes an offline reality, everything will not be the same (Fanfan).
>
> Online romance literally means romantic relationship online. So what
> can you rely on to maintain the relationship? Occasionally seeing each
> other using webcam? Getting intimate through the keyboard? Sometimes
> online romance indeed provides us a unique feeling, a sense of
> emotional comfort, but… (Ermodang).

‘Platonic emotional love’ is frequently used to refer to these
exclusively Internet-based romantic relationships because of the absence
of actual bodily interactions between the dyads. For example, Internet
user Maio Chenlin wrote, “Platonic love \~ \~ very much the theory of
online romance \~\~\~\~”, while Zhe said, “online romance is the
legendary Platonic love. If you wish for true love … arrange a meeting
with the loved one in the real world.” Similarly, another Internet user,
Keerhu argued against using the Internet to pursue ‘Platonic-style
emotion love’ as he considered it wrong to exclude corporeal
interactions in a relationship.

Some online daters choose to partake in ‘Platonic love’, by which I mean
they have no intention or desire to expand the relationship offline and
are content with the relationship’s mere online existence. Others
reluctantly become Platonic online daters as they are either unable to
overcome the physical distance that separates them or to defy the social
norms that discourage their amorous liaison. Despite their longing for
corporeal intimacy, this latter group of online daters unwillingly
accept that their relationship cannot goes offline. As they call
themselves Platonic lovers, they unintentionally broaden the meaning of
Platonic love to include also relationships with erotic impulses which
regrettably cannot be consumed. In other words, *Platonic*[^15_Chin_18] love
used in Chinese discourses of online romance refers to emotional love
without physical interactions, but might not necessary preclude sexual
desire.

Those pursuing *Platonic* online romance by choice seem to approach
their relationship strategically for self-gratification. They rely on
this relationship for the excitement or distractions needed to spice up
their banal everyday life, satisfy their unfulfilled emotional needs,
and provide solace in the face of life’s adversities. They carefully
demarcate the online and offline world to limit the negative impacts
their online activities may have on their offline life and show no sign
of confusing the two. There is a clear priority put on the offline
reality and they utilize their online relationship to improve the
quality of their daily life. They are, therefore, content with the
disembodied presence of their lover in the virtual world, motivated not
by physical intimacy. Calling their online romance *Platonic* love not
only conveys a sense of lofty spiritual love unsullied by carnal lust,
it also softens the image of a cheating partner as a mere online
emotional liaison is allegedly innocuous. Although there are also
*Platonic* online daters who genuinely appreciate the coming together of
the two minds, and treasure the deep emotional bonds that developed as a
result of their regular mutual self-disclosure, most express a rather
practical attitude towards online romance. For instance,

> Life pressure in contemporary society is enormous. There is nothing
> wrong with using online romance to rejuvenate one’s life. Many
> people’s family life is not perfect anyway. Chatting with several
> boyfriends and girlfriends online doesn’t make it worse. It can
> perhaps even improve the family relations (Wodeaizaoyibuzai).
>
> Family life is tedious and boring, but most people refuse to be
> content with the prosaic life. Everyone is longing to re-experience
> passion and romantic love, and inject new exciting elements into life,
> but there is a heavy price to pay for infidelity... Online romance
> easily fulfils this emotional void... (Baobeibuku)

In the post-Mao China, Marxist ideologies and class struggle no longer
dominate the political discourse and are replaced by pragmatism, which
also becoming the guiding philosophy of the society.[^15_Chin_19] Deng once said
that “it doesn't matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it
catches mice” to make the argument that socialism is not strictly
defined by a planned economy, and a market economy can also serve the
socialist state to promote growth and improve the living standards of
the people.[^15_Chin_20] As the nation embraced the late Deng’s exhortation that
“to get rich is glorious”, this has had profound implications on the
society as most people adopted an instrumental approach in their
everyday life. Compounded with the party-state’s ideological commitment
to atheism, many in the society experienced a sense of moral vacuum,
emotional emptiness and spiritual bankruptcy.[^15_Chin_21] Furthermore, since
the market reforms, individuals have been told to take greater personal
responsibilities in life as the state withdraws the social supports that
once catered for each individual from the cradle to the grave.[^15_Chin_22] Yet
the development of individualization in China is curtailed by the
absence of a democratic culture and welfare system to protect and
support individuals.[^15_Chin_23] The lack of constitutional protection and
social support render life in contemporary post-socialist Chinese
society highly competitive and stressful for many ordinary people. This
explains the motivation of pragmatist fantasists who strategically make
use of online relationships to romanticize their everyday life and as a
means to seek emotional comfort. In the following section, I will
elucidate the practice of pragmatist fantasist through the story of one
of my participants.

## The Pragmatist Fantasist 

Online romance presents pragmatic fantasists the opportunity to
re-experience the stereotypical romantic love, or at least the fantasy
of it. This can be seen in the way many online daters describe the
experience of being engulfed by the flame of passionate love beyond
their rational control. The outpouring heightened emotions have a
mysterious self-transforming and transcendental quality. It allows
lovers to put aside all worldly concerns, such as money, status,
background differences, social norms, and concentrate only on their
innermost feelings with the ideal lover. These feelings of stereotypical
romantic love also provide pragmatic fantasists with the therapeutic
function of distraction away from the miseries felt in everyday life and
through the constant practice of ‘disclosing intimacy’ online,[^15_Chin_24] they
also come closer to being a self-reflexive subject. Therefore, they
treat online romance as an effective means to the end of self-help and
improvement.

Despite the romantic undertone, couples engaging in this type of online
relationship may not necessarily consider their relationship a serious
romance. Often, they are regarded as flexible, contingent and open forms
of emotional relationship, not always motivated by sexual desire.
Although some participants may have longing for physical intimacy with
their partner, this desire is usually not acted upon. The decision not
to have anything to do with each other offline is made for several
reasons. Firstly, to limit the online relationship’s potentially
negative impact on the primary relationship or family life offline;
secondly, to help sustain its magical quality that is crucial to
invigorate their tedious everyday life and make them feel rejuvenated.
The kind of relationship they desire, in fact, thrives in the virtual
enclosure because its distance from reality is crucial for the
relationship to fulfil its therapeutic function of self-discovery and
romanticizing everyday life. In other words, pragmatic fantasists pursue
largely *Platonic* emotional love. The nature of relationships of this
kind is akin to Giddens’ notion of pure relationship, the
self-gratifying relationship.[^15_Chin_25] The relationship is ‘pure’ because it
is no longer organized by the network of kinship and community, but
driven by the reflexive self, and it is continued so long as it is
fulfilling to the individuals involved.

Giddens’ pure relationship is in practice difficult to achieve or
possible only among the privileged. In China, despite the emergence of a
nouveau riche and growing middle class, making ends meet is still the
daily preoccupation of the majority. The high cost of marriage, the
social anxiety of being single, family responsibilities and reputation
give many no liberty to walk out regardless of how dissatisfied they are
with their relationship. It is only within cyberspace that many have the
opportunity to experience the therapeutic self-satisfying pure
relationship based on equality of emotional exchanges. Acting as a
release valve, online romance provides feelings of being understood,
happiness, gratification, hope and intimacy, hence hard-pressed Chinese
feel invigorated when they go back to the reality of everyday life. Some
of them may occasionally be tempted to cross the online and offline
boundaries. However, such boundary crossing does not serve their
purposes of seeking emotional sustenance and distraction, and thus,
reaffirm the distinction between the two realms.

AZ (not real name) is one of my participants who, like so many other
pragmatist fantasists, turned to online romance for solace, emotional
support and self-experimentation. He is a married school teacher I met
on *Love Apartment*. He disguised his actual occupation and used
somebody else’s photograph in his profile because he was worried that
his activities on the site would compromise his role model image for his
students and raise suspicion of extramarital affairs. He told me that so
far he had had about 10 experiences of online cohabitation with
different female members, mostly initiated by him, lasting from six
months to just a few days. With just one exception, he mostly refrained
from having any offline contact beyond the site with his female
partners. “I don’t know and don’t want to know their real names,
addresses or telephone numbers.” He took none of these relationships
seriously, nor did he perceive them as romantic. “What I am looking for
is fun, nothing significant or meaningful, which means I am not going to
expand these relationships into the real world. They are merely
emotional.” His statement suggests that ‘emotional’ is secondary to his
life in the physical world in which he has established social roles to
play and maintain. “To be honest, I enjoy the freedom and excitement
online. I am lacking in these in my life. I have no opportunity to
pursue these needs due to work, family, finance, norms and other social
strictures.” He perceived the site as a place where he can relax and
unwind himself. “When I am feeling tired from work and prosaic daily
routine, I come here for relaxation. Perhaps here helps me to adjust to
my everyday life.” The easy availability of distant intimacy from the
site is liberating and entertaining to AZ. He light-heartedly enjoyed
the therapeutic functions of his online relationships. These included a
boosted sense of self and feelings of invigoration, but at the same time
a dismissiveness of the significance of these relationships.

Pursuing *Platonic* emotional love that is devoid of physical embodied
interactions should, however, not be mistaken as embracing the Cartesian
view of the superiority of the mind over the body. All the Chinese
Internet users I encountered during the course of my study had no doubt
on the importance of the body in romantic relationships. Neither were
they enthusiastic about cyberspace’s disembodiment in general. They are
taking advantage of the Internet for what it does best, in this case,
connecting people, extending human communication capacities which, in
the process, fulfils their emotional needs and promotes their
psychological wellbeing.

In addition to *Platonic* emotional love, ‘play’ is another important
conceptual term that Chinese Internet users draw on heavily in their
discussion of online romance. Cyberspace provides a perfect playground
for self-immersion and exploration, reflecting the view of the
‘sceptic’, the second category of Chinese online daters which will be
discussed after examining the notion of ‘play’ in the Chinese discourse
of online romance.

## Play 

It is perhaps not a surprise that many associate online romance with
game as most users I observed online, indeed, met their lover while
playing games online. They often expressed doubt in the seriousness of
their relationships. Relationships originating from the play domain have
often been the target of online romance critics. These critics are
suspicious of online daters’ levels of commitment and the authenticity
of the relationships. My study showed that critics’ scepticism often
also turns into cynicism as they urge online daters to adopt a playful
approach to the relationship to avoid getting hurt. Not surprising that
this creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for ‘players’ as they fall in
and out of love more quickly than those who take the relationship
seriously.

> Online romance can be described as a type of adult game. It is
> illusory and cannot be materialized (Wodeaizaoyibuzai).

… online romance is only a play, a dream (Guoguo).

> Online romance is love play, whoever becomes serious, he/she will be
> the loser (Taxiangyu).
>
> Games are governed by rules. Online romance also has its rules. The
> rule is never to take it too seriously. If not, it would turn prosaic.
> Frustrations would also ensue. Plagued with too many miseries, it
> would no longer be online romance (Baobeibuku).

The commentator of the last quote suggests that online romance’s
enchantment would vanish when it stops being a game. She continues to
argue that there are advantages in deliberately treating online romance
as play. Online romance is fascinating because

> it has no responsibilities. Love without responsibilities is relaxing,
> but at the same time illusionary … just by talking everyone can enjoy
> being in love, no monetary investment required, not much obligation
> and is mutually entertaining. Such a good deal should indeed be
> encouraged!

The playfulness of online romance renders it unreliable, but a
low-investment, low- risk romantic pursuit, in turn, encourages Internet
users to explore and experiment with love online. Players have low
expectations on what they can hope for because commitments are rare and
they are therefore unburdened by the weight associated with serious love
affairs. Turning online relationships into play also implies that the
relationship ought to be enjoyed as an intrinsic activity in itself, not
as a means to find an offline date or a long-term partner. Play by
nature is short lived and the only purpose is to have fun, enjoying the
excitement and amusement play brings. Huizinga defined play as

> a free activity standing quite consciously outside ‘ordinary’ life as
> being ‘not serious’, but at the same time absorbing the player
> intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material
> interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its
> own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and
> in an orderly manner.[^15_Chin_26]

This definition’s emphasis on the separation between play and reality is
especially germane to the discussion here. According to Huizinga, to
play means stepping out of real life into a temporary sphere of activity
with its own governing rules. Play is captivating and satisfying in
itself, complementing life in general. Without such separation, playing
make-believe of a second reality would be difficult and it is the rules
that create and sustain the frame of play within certain limits of time
and place.[^15_Chin_27] Playing at love online could be liberating, stimulating
and transforming, if not at least entertaining and relaxing. The
engrossment provides a form of escape or distraction from the mundane
and often disappointing everyday realities.

Whitty also theorized online relationships as a form of play, external
to everyday reality, fragile and ephemeral as it can only be sustained
if players play by the rules and thereby keep its own frame alive.[^15_Chin_28]
In the psychodynamic view, play can promote the development of self and
facilitate psychological growth and general health. The Internet
provides a safe place for users not only to play with the relationships,
but also their identities that could lead to increased self-awareness
and acceptance with improved self-esteem.[^15_Chin_29] This indeed reflects the
motivation of some *Platonic* daters who pragmatically turn to the
Internet to promote their emotional wellbeing. But for sceptics of
online romance, when using the term ‘play or game’, they tend to
downplay its psychological benefits, but focus instead, on its spirit of
non-instrumentality and inconsequentiality, which, according to Simmel,
in his article about sociability, are the gaming principles that also
govern most social events.[^15_Chin_30]

The ‘ludus’ way of loving, a casual and noncommittal game playing
romantic relationship, is nothing new as suggested in Lee’s typology of
styles of loving,[^15_Chin_31] but the Internet provides a context particularly
suitable for this style of love. Participants of ‘ludic(rous)’ Internet
relationships often show “an utter lack of concern for depth, solemnity,
seriousness, civility, and respect.”[^15_Chin_32] Getting sexually or
emotionally closer to someone met online, yet calling it mere play has
the effect of trivializing the relationship and making it innocuous
because play is not real. The ‘only pretending’ consciousness of play
makes everyday moral ethics, virtues, manners, social norms and
strictures less readily applicable to play.[^15_Chin_33] This explains why
transgressive love affairs are likely to be condoned if confined within
cyberspace. A transgressive online relationship that expands into the
offline world would stop being play, hence needing to be regulated.

Through play, players can exercise their agency, try to take control,
defy and oppose the status quo. Henricks summarized Huizinga’s work on
play as

> to play is to take on the world, to take it apart, and frequently to
> build it anew. So understood, play for Huizinga is a protest against
> determinism, a claim that humans need not merely endure existential
> conditions but can reform these according to their own desires and
> insights.[^15_Chin_34]

Although players are unable to directly challenge and immediately
undermine the dominant ideologies, play, nevertheless, is a way for them
to express themselves, to tell their stories, and form a community of
support. As argued by Scott, symbolic resistance and defiance by
society’s underdogs should not be dismissed lightly.[^15_Chin_35] Furthermore,
play may seem opposed to everyday reality, but it is also simultaneously
part of it. The relationship between a society and the games it likes to
play is reciprocal and mutually reflective of one another.[^15_Chin_36] In other
words, games affect the culture of the society as much as being affected
by it.

Other advantages of a playful approach to online romance include
allowing incongruous motives or conflicting interests to co-exist and
minimizing the risk of failure, lightening the pain of rejection, and
making exploration or experimentation possible. “Online romance is not
real romance, so even if split up, it would not result in too much
pain”, pointed by participant Jitenglian. Becoming a playboy or playgirl
online and feeling desirable is also a boost to one’s self-esteem.

Online daters’ playfulness may appear superficial to sceptical
outsiders, but it requires digital competency and emotional rhetoric to
successfully manoeuvre between play and reality. Just as the boundaries
between the offline life and the online world are permeable, the border
of play and ordinary life is not always clear-cut. When and where
reality stops being reality, and play stops being play is not always
obvious or undisputable, therefore each can have considerable influence
on the other. For example, excessive playing of flirtatious
relationships online can have negative effects on the primary
relationship despite the idea that play would normally imply not having
real and serious consequences in the wider world. In his study of games
as social encounters, Goffman argued that what makes the encounters fun
is a selective connection to the world beyond. Too much separation may
render the play trivial and boring, too little separation may discourage
players’ engrossment in the play.[^15_Chin_37] In summary, successful play is
one where players themselves control the level of separation to achieve
the right balance, simultaneously maintaining the sense of both
connection and disconnection. However, ideal it may seem, only seasoned
players would have the competency to negotiate between the two for
maximum joy. Most would risk turning initial pleasure into compulsion,
enjoyment into obsession, a casual and responsibility-free relationship
into a serious love affair.

## The Sceptic

Those users not in favor of online romance are mostly sceptical about
its feasibility and authenticity. Their apprehension is based not only
on the problematic tendency to contrast the virtual with the real, but
also the conviction that online romance is a free play of make-believe,
an imagined fairytale that is fun but transient, therefore should only
be consumed incorporeally within cyberspace.

> Online romance has enchanted beauty. Online romance makes some people
> obsessive. Online romance makes love even more romantic. Online
> romance embellishes life with the beauty of confusion. But no matter
> what, regardless of how much more beautiful is online romance, it is
> just too virtual (Ermodang).

The virtual nature of online romance that frees participants from social
norms and moral obligations is the main worry of online romance
sceptics. Those who desire to move the romantic relationship offline
would be regarded by the sceptics as confusing play with reality and
representing a futile attempt because transcendental romantic affairs
are always short-lived. They argue that the excitements and enchantments
of online romance lie precisely in its virtual nature with a distance
away from reality. It allows misrepresentations and sustains the
illusion of a fairytale with heightened and volatile emotions.

> I think online romance is only suitable in cyberspace. When it goes
> offline, its quality deteriorates (83gzhuazi).
>
> Reality is never as good as the virtual world. It is romantic, because
> the Internet hides its ugly side. Only when keeping the online romance
> within cyberspace, does it remain perfect (Heizi).

Sceptics of online romance subscribe to the realist model of prosaic
love. They are critically aware of the incompatibilities between
idealistic online romance and the semantic and phenomenological
properties of everyday life which is tedious and occupied with earthly
petty concerns and chores.[^15_Chin_38] Therefore, they are critical of the
fantasy online romance creates but encourage recreational consumption of
this fantasy by playing along and enjoying the feel-good effects it
brings. In other words, play has become the rhetorical answer for the
sceptics of online romance. It resolves the significance of their
concerns and allows them to conveniently enjoy the online romantic’s
romantic ideals while at the same time cynically laughing at its
triviality.

As opposed to the sceptics, the romantic realists have the aspiration to
turn online romance into a social reality. They perceive online romance
as not essentially different from romantic relationships initiated in
the face-to-face world. In fact, relationships online built upon a
foundation of constant emotional exchange and deeper mutual
understandings are considered to be more meaningful by this category of
online Internet users which will be discussed next.

## The Romantic Realist

Romantic realists argue against the idea of ‘romancing online’ and
understand online romance as initiated online but gradually expand
offline and potentially cumulate long-term courtship, cohabitation or
marriage. This perception of online romance is consistent with the
dominant understanding of online romance. As romantic realists harbor
the intention to move online romance offline, sustaining the heightened
emotion and turning it into offline reality is the challenge. Embracing
realistic expectations and not deliberately misrepresenting oneself
online are advice given to couples to help overcome the challenge of
transition from online to offline. *Jian guang si*, or perish upon
exposing to the reality offline, is the most commonly discussed problem
facing the romantic realists. It refers to the inevitable end of an
online relationship when the dyad crosses the boundary by expanding
their relationship offline. It is not the only worry that puts many
online daters off from meeting in person. Physical distance between the
two can also be a practical problem. Until either one relocates to be
with the other, regular bodily interactions are impossible. Having to
endure romantic love devoid of embodied presence is one of the serious
drawbacks of online romance for romantic realists. Many online daters in
this category lament the pain of being deprived of corporeal intimacy.

Romantic realists’ concerns are closely related to their realization
that technologies do not liberate human beings from the constraints of
physical distance and embodiment which are paramount to the maintenance
of romantic relationships. Advice given to online daters often includes
regularly spending time together offline to truly understand each other
and to make sure both get along well. If the relationship survives *jian
guang si* and is successfully transferred offline, it will then be
subjected to the same influence of social conventions, cultural
practices, familial norms and values that affect people’s dating
behaviors, for example, “we dated online for two years and went offline.
It went well, but was eventually destroyed by family members…”, a
personal experience of Wujunnan.

Of course in reality, the three categories (pragmatist fantasists,
sceptics and romantic realists) identified in this study are not
mutually exclusive. An individual may pragmatically choose to pursue
*Platonic* emotional love online, but in the process get carried away by
the intense romantic affection that leaves him/her contemplating the
possibility of expanding the relationship offline. Meanwhile, he/she
remains sceptical because of the conviction that the reality of everyday
life is simply incompatible with the idealistic online romance. In the
next section, I will discuss the similarities and differences of the
three categories.

## The Dynamic of the Three Categories

One thing in common between sceptics and pragmatic fantasists is they
see online romance as a fairytale, too good to be true in the offline
world and it is the virtuality of the Internet that sustains the
wonderful illusion. The difference between sceptics’ playful approach
and pragmatic fantasists’ utilitarian approach to online romance lies in
the former’s ruling spirit of non-instrumentality and
inconsequentiality. According to Simmel, non-instrumentality means that
socializing and playing is engaged in for its own sake, not as a means
for attaining certain goals; while inconsequentiality insists on the
importance of not being in earnest and just having fun.[^15_Chin_39] Pragmatic
fantasists, on the other hand, are motivated to use the relationships to
help meet those emotional needs unfulfilled in everyday life. The
relationships could turn serious and meaningful for some couples.

Chinese romantic realists desire to gradually expand their mode of
communication, often from the initial textual interaction online to
face-to-face meetings in due course. While the Internet may eventually
become obsolete in their relationship as they shift flexibly between the
online and the offline, this is however the opposite of how sceptical
online daters and pragmatic fantasists experience their online romance.
Romantic realists see the intertwining between the online and offline
world as natural and inevitable, but the other two groups on the
contrary, attempt to re-enact the boundaries between the online and
offline world by repeatedly emphasizing on the benefits of keeping two
realms apart from one another. In their discussion of online romance,
the Internet is constantly being contrasted with the real life, the
reality of offline world, the physical, the tangible, and the actual.
Many of them opposed the idea of expanding online romance to the offline
world, either because of their belief that the idealistic relationship
can only live within cyberspace or it is morally wrong or irresponsible
to let online activities affect the primary relationships or family
life.

Residing in a northern province of China, Nakai (not real name) aged 24
in 2010, worked as an administrator at a careers service center. She
shared her personal experience of online romance with me. Her narrative
showed how she flexibly shifted between the three attitudes and how the
Internet empowered her to pursue a homosexual relationship.

## The Self-empowerment Story of Online Romance

At the time of my study in 2010, Nakai was in a relationship with
someone met online. She revealed to me that “my current partner is a
woman. My previous partners were all men.” The relationship began after
her colleague passed her contact number for QQ, a Chinese online instant
messaging service, to Mei (not real name). Mei contacted her online and
their relationship developed as they chatted regularly. Mei came to
visit her after three months of online liaison and their first
face-to-face meeting functioned to affirm and consolidate their romantic
relationship. Mei later relocated to be with Nakai, but moved back after
four months because the job she had there was not suitable. However, Mei
planned to come again the following year.

Mei had been Nakai’s colleague’s offline friend of two years. Since they
became romantically involved, her colleague was apologetic as she did
not know that Nakai had a homoerotic impulse and regretted making the
introduction which was initially intended to be merely a social
relationship. This homosexual relationship has been hidden from Nakai’s
parents because she anticipated their strong reaction and prohibition.
However, she became determined that when Mei returned in 2011, she would
move out of her parents’ home to live with Mei, without confessing the
nature of their relationship to her parents. Mei is a year younger than
Nakai. And according to Nakai, she was “born a lesbian. She always loved
women and has dated several women in the past.” When asked if she had
deliberately suppressed her true sexual orientation in the past, Nakai
replied that she only realized that she also loved women after she met
Mei. However, it was not Mei who transformed Nakai from a heterosexual
to homosexual. Nakai told me that

> When I was in high school and university, I admired two female fellow
> classmates. But I was not sure whether this feeling was friendship or
> romantic love. Furthermore, at that time, I was not convinced that it
> is possible for two females to be together. I thought this only
> happened in TV drama. Unrealistic. So I did not do anything. After I
> started to work, I began to contemplate the idea of dating a women. I
> knew a lesbian, who confided to me that she liked to be with me, but I
> had no feelings towards her. So I refused… Previously, I was not clear
> whether or not I really like women, because I had not tried. So I was
> uncertain about my true feelings.

After being in relationship with Mei, Nakai realized that a homosexual
relationship suited her better than a relationship with the opposite
sex. “I love her very much, much more than any of my ex-lovers. I want
to be with her regardless of family’s disapproval.” Most of her friends
knew that she was dating a woman and they were mostly supportive. The
main challenge she encounters, like so many other homosexuals in China,
is to ask for her family’s acceptance. Her initial doubt on the
feasibility of same-sex relationships is understandable in a society
that exercises compulsory heterosexuality.[^15_Chin_40] Although she previously
did not act upon her homoerotic impulse, her interest in same-sex love
remained and it later facilitated the acceptance of her own sexuality.
When asked if she felt confused and struggled to come to terms with her
own sexuality, Nakai replied, “No struggle at all. I felt as natural as
loving a man.” When talking about the role of the Internet in her
self-identification with a marginal sexual identity, she replied that

> I have been researching online to learn more about lesbianism,
> especially since I met Mei. It enhanced my understanding of the
> community, clarified my doubts, knowing that it is possible for
> females to develop romantic relationships and live together gave me
> lots of courage.

The exposure to a homosexual community online convinced Nakai that there
was nothing wrong or abnormal about same-sex love. Interacting with
other female same-sex couples gave her assurance and encouraged her to
live the life she desired. Narrative is one of the resources we turn to
for self-understanding and construction of the self.[^15_Chin_41] Through
narrative, individuals reconfigure the present and reinterpret the past
in order to present a coherent and integrated sense of self. When Nakai
narrates her current relationship with Mei, she relates it with her past
experience of sexual curiosities with women. By so doing, the same-sex
relationship does not constitute a break in her sexual identity. Her
continuous sense of self could have led to the smooth transition from
cross-sex love to same-sex love.

Talking about her first online romance, Nakai said it was her first
love, the most memorable experience of all, but also the most hurtful.
They met in an online forum in 2006 when she was 20, and had just
started at university. They met in person once. Despite living far apart
she looked forward to visiting him during holidays and was prepared to
relocate to the south of China to be with him after graduation. He was
also a student, but soon to graduate from university. Sadly, Nakai later
found out that he already had a girlfriend offline and was not serious
in their relationship. After the relationship was over she continued to
develop several other cross-sex online romances. The longest
relationship lasted for a year, while the shortest was only a month. She
came to know almost all of her lovers at online forums. When I asked if
she was serious in these relationships, she replied,

> Hard to say. I was once serious in all these relationships, but how
> long my seriousness lasted varied. I was serious throughout some of
> the relationships, but there were also others in which I was serious
> to begin with but after I became aware that the relationships had no
> prospects, I treated them as play.

This flexibly adjustable level of seriousness indicates Nakai’s
pragmatic approach towards online romance. When the relationship is not
likely to deliver the ideal outcome, she turns it into play. By doing
so, she can enjoy the distractions brought by the relationships while
minimizing the risk of getting hurt.

Nakai enjoys developing relationships with others online because as an
introvert, face-to-face communication with people she does not know is
not easy. The Internet not only increases her opportunity to meet new
friends and engage in communication on a deeper emotional level, but
also allows greater control of her self-presentation. Her second
motivation for developing online relationships is they are good “when
feeling bored. They can be used for recreation.” These relationships
although not profound love, can still temporarily “satisfy the need of
being loved and cared for.” What is most important is not to be too
serious and let oneself delve too deep into the relationship, otherwise,
one risks breaking one’s own heart.” Not surprisingly, she did not seem
to be disappointed by short-lived online love affairs. She also argued
that over reliance on the Internet for solace can be debilitating.
“Long-term indulgence in cyberspace will result in loss of confidence in
real life, having difficulties to communicate with others face-to-face.”
Nakai’s attitude reflects the quintessential element of the pragmatic
fantasist who prioritizes the quotidian existence in the offline world,
and the sceptic’s playful approach to relationships online.

Nakai admitted that she once dated two or three different men online at
once. But these relationships were short-lived and she was exhausted
from trying to maintain all these relationships. When asked if she
considered herself cheating, she replied that these relationships were
just play, so faithfulness was not relevant. Nakai contended that only
online romance that stood the test of offline reality can be called
genuine love and deserves commitment. Online romance in itself is just a
temporary outlet for emotional stimulation and for one to indulge in
casual love affairs. This statement demonstrates that she is not
rejecting the romantic realist’s aspiration. Her own experience with Mei
is, in fact, a vivid example of online romance going offline and
becoming a social reality.

Nakai’s overall experiences of the Internet, and online romance in
particular, were beneficial to her self-experimentation and acceptance.
She was not only able to explore and affirm the other side of her
sexuality, but also improved her social skills online. Nakai’s
self-confidence may not be particularly high, but she has a strong sense
of self-efficacy in overcoming challenges and life adversities. Her
determination to live with Mei, to pursue her own choice of life is
perhaps the most vivid example of the exercise of agency. The way she
describes her transitions and identification with the marginalized
sexual identity is surprisingly smooth, unlike many reported accounts of
internal struggle and self-rejection. Familial traditions and social
norms might be a constraining force for Nakai, but she is not afraid of
the obstacles. As a self-determining person, she is adept at looking for
resources and support online, therefore has the means to empower herself
in living her choice of same-sex love.

## Conclusion

*‘Platonic* emotional love’ and ‘play’ are two key conceptual terms in
Chinese discourse of online romance. Both are made possible by a
deliberate and careful demarcation of the online and offline world into
two separate terrains. Instead of simply dismissing Chinese Internet
users’ online and offline dichotomy as regressive or naive, I focused
instead on what it can achieve for them. Chinese are acutely aware that
the online and offline worlds are inextricably linked but when it comes
to interpersonal relationships, they choose to reinstate the online and
offline boundary because it serves their purposes of looking for
distraction and emotional solace. What they aim for is not a replacement
for their often less satisfied everyday life in the offline world, but
to use online relationships as a means to help them to improve the
quality of their daily existence.

The ‘pragmatic fantasist’ is the key character in exclusively
Internet-based *Platonic* emotional love. They approach online
relationships instrumentally, aiming to find sustenance in these
relationships of distant intimacy, making them the source of emotional
stimulation and solace. Some of these relationships grow in intensity
over time and become meaningful to the couples. Others remain shallow
but are nevertheless appreciated for the good fantasies and
reinvigoration provided that ease participants’ tense and mundane
everyday lives, while being weightless and risk free. I argue that the
desire for pure affection, anything ‘emotional’ as opposed to embodied,
materialist or mercenary by pragmatic fantasists is a reaction to the
highly commodified and stressful quotidian existence in contemporary
Chinese society.

The word ‘play’ is frequently used by the ‘sceptic’ to describe online
romance. Their sceptical attitude towards online romance often also
turns into cynicism when they call for a playful approach to online
romance and argue that it is unwise to take online romance too seriously
as it is just an inconsequential game. Treating online relationships as
social gaming has the dual functions of warning online daters not to
commit too easily to the relationship, or expect too much from it, and
providing a license for experimentation in carefree online intimacies. A
playful approach also helps some to cope with the inherent conflicts
between reality and virtuality. Through play, the real is rendered
virtual and players have the opportunity to work out their problems and
test out options available.[^15_Chin_42]

I use the term ‘romantic realists’ to label those who consider online
romance as not essentially different from romantic relationships
initiated face-to-face. They follow the Western trajectory of online
romance in defining successful online romance as cumulating in marriage
and long long-term relationships in the offline world. Once the
relationship goes offline, the couple is subjected to the same cultural
practices, traditions, social norms and conventions governing familial
life and love affairs. Keeping a relationship online and calling it a
play is a way to shield it from the influence of prevailing normative
forces.

In therapeutic culture, online relationships could be empowering as they
help couples to deal with their emotional emptiness and pain, preparing
them to cope with the tensions and uncertainties resulting from the
volatile and chaotic nature of selfhood and social relationships in late
modernity.[^15_Chin_43] The therapeutic model of relationship also helps
individuals to discover their true-selves and become autonomous persons
leading an authentic life.[^15_Chin_44]

Finally, the experience of online romance and its social implications
depend on the participants’ attitudes towards online romance, whether
they are being pragmatic, sceptical or realistic in their pursuit of the
relationships online. As pointed out by Hine, the Internet’s functions
and meanings do indeed vary from individual to individual because its
risks and opportunities are perceived differently in relation to each
individual’s concerns and needs.[^15_Chin_45]
