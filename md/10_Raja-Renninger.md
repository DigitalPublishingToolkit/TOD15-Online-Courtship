# Remediating the Matchmaker: Arranging Marriage Online in the South Asian Diaspora in America

### Sheena Raja and Bryce J. Renninger

The topic of marriage is a major focus of conversations about the
“modernization” of South Asian culture in the face of social processes
that fall under the vague and multivalent concept of globalization.[^10_Raja-Renninger_1]
This chapter seeks to destabilize various assumptions about the
contemporary status of marriage in a globalized world by focusing on the
role of matrimonial websites in the lives of diasporic South Asians in
New Jersey and New York. In what follows, we acknowledge how “tradition”
and “modernity” coexist and coincide in the South Asian diaspora in the
United States with regards to the use of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) to pursue intimacy, love, and marriage.

Globalization is often thought of in terms of global flows of capital.
But when one takes note of the forms of capital that flow in a
globalized world – money, products, labor, specialized knowledge, it is
hard to ignore the role of humans in these transnational flows. As
subjects migrate and reimagine space, ICTs impact the maintenance of
family and other social ties, cultural production and consumption, and
pursuit of intimacy, love, and marriage for members of the South Asian
diaspora. In addition to using ICTs to maintain local and national ties,
South Asians on the Indian subcontinent and in the diaspora also use
ICTs to seek out information and communication on a transnational scale,
creating transnational ethnoscapes, technoscapes, and mediascapes, a
dynamic interplay between people, technology, and audio/visual
media.[^10_Raja-Renninger_2]

This chapter distinguishes itself among other studies of contemporary
arranged marriage amongst South Asians by focusing on the practices of
U.S. diasporic South Asians and by acknowledging the many actors – human
and non-human – that factor into the arranged marriage process amongst
this social group. In what follows, we use the term “South Asian
diaspora,” even though the subjects in the study are of Indian descent.
Though there are small regional differences in marriage practices
between villages, cities, nations, regions, and religious and ethnic
groups, the coeval existence of arranged and love marriages, matchmakers
and Internet sites is standard for many across the region and its
diaspora.

## Marriage in the South Asian Diaspora: Arrangements, Assisting, and Love

Within South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, marriages are popularly
conceived in one of two genres: the arranged marriage or the love
marriage. In this formulation, love marriages are tied to modernity, or,
alternatively, to “Western culture.” This kind of analysis may or may
not acknowledge that in the West, love became a priority in the pursuit
of marriages only in the eighteenth century.[^10_Raja-Renninger_3] In the West, tying love
marriages to modernity has led to representations of arranged marriages
as old-fashioned or outdated. These perspectives ignored reasons why
arranged marriages existed. Speaking of the cultural conditions that
shape arranged marriage in the Indian context, Seth and Patnayakuni
commented,

> From a very young age, children are socialized to identify with the
> family as a whole and discouraged from developing an autonomous self.
> They are conditioned to place the interests of the family ahead of
> their own. Alienating and confronting parents and family is still an
> anathema to most young people, especially in important decisions such
> as career selection and marriage. Furthermore, cultural mores frown
> upon the socialization among men and women in the form of dating and
> relationships. As a result, arranged marriage is still the dominant
> way for families and individuals to find partners for marriage.[^10_Raja-Renninger_4]

This formulation did not account for the many ways that transnational
migration and diasporic subjectivity impact marriage configurations.
Seth and Patnayakuni later acknowledged,

> over the past several decades, social and geographical mobility have
> weakened the extended family structure and increasingly replaced it
> with a more nuclear family structure. As a consequence, social
> networks provided by the extended family structure are no longer
> available to parents for finding suitable partners for their
> marriageable offspring. [^10_Raja-Renninger_5]

Here, Seth and Patnayakuni have argued that these factors had made
online matrimonial sites ever more popular from within the educated
(diasporic) middle class. Although love and arranged marriages have been
popular classifications from within the South Asian context, this
dichotomy simplified the processes that lead to each of these marriages.
Especially in families with transnational networks or the possibility of
transnational networks, assisted marriages are popular. In assisted
marriages,

> the parents/kin arrange for a set of prospective spouses based on
> criteria around religion, caste, education, occupation, age, and
> geography, among others. They find socially acceptable ways to
> introduce their children. These may be through large family get
> togethers, weddings, and other social or cultural events.[^10_Raja-Renninger_6]

As is implied in this quote, assisted marriages are sometimes based on
transnational networks of sociality that have pre-existed, but sometimes
trusted consultants like matchmakers or astrologers are consulted[^10_Raja-Renninger_7] or
matrimonial sites are used[^10_Raja-Renninger_8] to start or expand the search. Parents
who participate in assisted marriages “allow[ ] their sons and daughters
choice among nominees screened for caste, lineage, and geography, among
other measures – and giv[e] the children veto power.”[^10_Raja-Renninger_9]

There are many contexts where dating and love marriages, arranged
marriages, and assisted marriages all coexist as potentials and
possibilities for members of the South Asian diaspora. These coeval
possibilities and potentialities have the ability to be configured in
different ways by members of the same community, caste, or regional
ancestry or even within the same person. The diverse courtship practices
can also play a role in marking nationality, as noted by Marian Aguiar:

> The meaning of [India] is not a given, nor is it identical across
> different historical-geographical locations. Arranged marriage might
> become a way to ‘be Indian’ for a highly educated, professional man in
> New Jersey, and it might become a way to ‘be Bangladeshi’ for a woman
> from East London working in a garment factory, but these forms of
> imagining the nation are mediated by the structures of gender, class,
> and religion.[^10_Raja-Renninger_10]

What is left unsaid in this quote is that in certain situations,
pursuing configurations other than arranged marriages may also be tied
up in national or diasporic identity, how one’s real possibilities for
both arranged and love marriages may indicate a way of being diasporic.

This paper considers the ways that the model of the arranged marriage as
a model or an option coexists, coincides, and informs various other
pursuits of relationships for members of the South Asian diaspora. While
“dating violates the traditional Indian understanding of sexuality as
something to be encountered only in marriage,”[^10_Raja-Renninger_11] various Indian
nationals and members of the diaspora, against tradition, see dating as
a possibility. It is indisputable, for instance, that contemporary youth
on the subcontinent have more exposure to the possibility of
dating,[^10_Raja-Renninger_12] but other configurations of these possibilities exist
amongst many members of the South Asian diaspora. While transnational
migration is certainly facilitated by these sites[^10_Raja-Renninger_13] (and, in fact,
sites like Shaadi.com have developed strategic business partners that
help with issues around immigration), the subjects interviewed for this
chapter are citizens of the United States who, for the most part,
focused on finding other Americans for reasons explored in the analysis
of our interviews.

In a study of use of the Internet that related specifically to South
Asian diasporic identity, Adams and Ghose have found that South Asian
matrimonial sites, rather than focusing on photographs of the eligible
subject, include more information related to “caste, religion,
ethnicity, education and employment, which are considered by families to
be of greater relevance to marital happiness than physical
appearance.”[^10_Raja-Renninger_14] Various studies have pointed out that the desirability
of light-skinned mates has led to pursuits of romance that emphasized
skin color and caste and either misreported[^10_Raja-Renninger_15] or omitted data[^10_Raja-Renninger_16]
that would be unattractive.

## Methods

The aim of this study was to understand the motivations and practices of
diasporic South Asians when it came to the use of computer-mediated
platforms for courtship. The subjects for this study were recruited by
one of the researchers from within the New Jersey/New York South Asian
community of which she is a part.[^10_Raja-Renninger_17] The total South Asian diaspora in
the U.S. is overwhelmingly comprised of individuals with reported
ancestry from India (80%), and the rest from Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and the Maldives.[^10_Raja-Renninger_18] According to the 2010
US Census, the New York Metro area[^10_Raja-Renninger_19] has the largest number of
residents identifying as Asian Indians, with over 500,000 counted.[^10_Raja-Renninger_20]
Starting from a sample of two previously known contacts, the sample
expanded using snowball sampling to total ten overall subjects.

Participants were selected if they were a diasporic South Asian living
in New York or New Jersey and had any first hand experience creating a
profile on any dating website or matrimonial website. Dating websites
allow users to search and contact individuals through filters, and offer
suggestions potential communication often with the intention to set up a
physical meeting. Matrimonial websites offer a similar functionality,
however, they do so with the clear intention that all communication is
in the service of pursuing marriage. All of the participants in the
study have either used or witnessed the first hand experience of the
South Asian-specific matrimonial site Shaadi.com[^10_Raja-Renninger_21] or one of its
subsidiaries for specific South Asian ethnicities (e.g.
GujaratMatrimony.com, where all users are from or have family from the
state of Gujarat). The popular dating sites Match.com and eHarmony.com
used by our participants are mass-marketed to American users as sites
without any ethnic identification (though eHarmony.com was started by a
Christian psychologist and theologian). All sites allow browsing to be
based on geographic proximity.

Interviews followed a guide that was developed to learn the tactics
users employed and purposes they had when creating profiles on both
dating and matrimonial sites. The guide also allowed users to talk about
the many different sites they used (if applicable). During interviews,
special attention was made to understand the types of interaction and
communication pursued and enacted on each website that they used.

After interviews, subjects were asked if they knew any South Asians in
the area who used matrimonial or dating sites. All interviews were done
in person or over Skype in early 2014. From the ten subjects, who ranged
from 26 to 35 years old, three were male, and seven were female. Most
conversations were about heterosexual courtship, although one subject
self-identified as bisexual. Of the men, two were born in the US and one
was born in India; of the women, five were born in the US and two were
born in India. All seven subjects born in the US are first-generation
Americans. Their religious affiliations, which included Hindu, Buddhist,
and Jain, were revealed over the course of interviews as it became
important for their courtship practices. All subjects have ethnic ties
to North India; they sometimes brought up their regional ethnicities
when those ethnicities played a factor in the pursuit of mates. Our
subjects’ steady access to high-speed Internet at home and on their
mobile phones were trappings of their presumed membership within the
American middle class. We coded each interview subject with a number,
which was used throughout to identify different subjects. A list of
subjects with age, gender, birth country, and religion, when provided,
is provided in the Appendix. Interviews were transcribed and coded based
on themes that emerged, some of which are explored below.

In the analysis that follows, we hope to reveal our findings that the
various actors that have existed in the South Asian matchmaking process
before the Internet – young people, their parents and other relatives,
matchmakers, astrologers, biodata – have been remediated by various
digital tools. Here, we borrow the term “remediation” from critics of
digital aesthetic forms Bolter and Grusin to note the ways that, new
media forms, in this case matrimonial sites and dating websites,
transmute previous forms into something somehow experienced in a both
more immediate and more hypermediated way.[^10_Raja-Renninger_22] In other words, with the
digital remediation of matchmaking processes, users are more aware of
both the process and structure of the mediated practice.

Before we provide our analyses of the interviews at the center of the
chapter, we first take a detour to a hotel and conference center in
Edison, New Jersey.

## Spectacular Matchmaking in Edison, New Jersey 

Traditionally, arranged marriages in India are brokered by matchmakers,
or *nayans*, who serve as community scouts and neutral liaisons
organizing communications between families, with little or no input from
the eligible individuals themselves.[^10_Raja-Renninger_23] Though matchmakers may be
friends or extended family members, professional matchmakers have played
a historical role in Indian society aligning families according to
wealth, property, caste, religion, and social status. Today, newspaper
advertisements, informal biodata (demographic information) profile
circulation, matrimonial websites and matchmaking cultural events have
also entered this space as the South Asian diaspora reimagines courtship
practices. The various methods of matchmaking each allows for various
configurations of individual autonomy and cultural expectations.

In 1995, a non-profit organization called Matri was founded by Yashvant
Patel to assist Gujarati eligibles in New Jersey in their quest to find
"life partners" that spoke Gujarati and shared common cultural values.
At its inception, Matri focused on organizing annual conventions where
hundreds of prospective brides, grooms and their parents across the U.S.
gathered in business casual attire for a weekend of food, music, and
dance as well as other social events that allowed people looking for
marriage partners to meet each other. Before arriving at the annual
convention, registered participants were asked to select the names of
five prospects they would like to meet from a booklet of colored
photographs and biodata profiles. At the event, participants were asked
to walk on stage, share their name, registration number, and a brief
introduction in 40 seconds or less. Afterwards, parents moved to a
separate area for a parents meeting guided by adult volunteers, and
young participants are broken up into groups for individual interviews.

Since then, attendance at Matri has expanded and the organization itself
has grown to include local chapters in areas across the country with a
high density of Gujarati Americans. Matri has also forged a partnership
with GujaratiMatrimony.com, a subsidiary of Bharatmatrimony.com, the
profitable Indian matrimonial website and self-proclaimed “trusted
partner in marriage.” As Patel boasts in a video interview embedded on
GujaratiMatrimony.com, users of the website have been able to “connect
to millions of Gujaratis worldwide.”[^10_Raja-Renninger_24] Not only has this organization
drawn a sponsor facilitating entrance into the digital space, but the
annual events have also been revamped to include a “speed dating”
session. Here we find that matrimonial sites such as Matri are
remediations of older forms of arrangement practices that now coexist in
complex systems of matchmaking.

## Remediating the Matchmaker

Following the lead of actor-network theory,[^10_Raja-Renninger_25] in addition to noting
the cultural forces of diaspora, immigration, and the transnational, we
should be attuned to the various human and non-human actors involved in
matchmaking. We have identified the eligible young people, their parents
and family, matchmakers, astrologists, dating and matrimonial sites,
online profiles, and social matching algorithms as key actors within the
system of South Asian diasporiccourtship. All of these actors have the
capability to be considered matchmakers. If hybrid forms like assisted
marriages are becoming popular for diasporic subjects, then what roles
do these actors in arrangement play in various forms of courtship
pursuit in the South Asian diasporic context? In answering this
question, it is important to note that all ten subjects saw themselves
as the primary agents in their pursuit of partners or dates.

Speaking about the interface of the site Indiandating.com, not a
matrimonial site but an ethnic dating site, Participant 1 noted that the
site and its database of users seemed more “traditional.”

> RAJA: So what do you mean by more traditional?
>
> PARTICIPANT 1: The questions they ask, they ask about caste. It was
> all voluntary. They were asking about things that I didn’t even know
> what it was like um...I mean...subcaste and...“manglik”[^10_Raja-Renninger_26] or
> something like that. Is that something?
>
> R: Is that astrology?
>
> P1: Yeah. So they ask about that. It was kind of funny because there’s
> a feature like a special feature where you had to pay more to see it.
> It seemed like they put a lot of weight on that. But like I don’t
> really care about that stuff [chuckle]...But yeah, it has like a piece
> of paper that is covered and there is a little piece that is turned
> up. So it is like hidden, but if you pay more then you can see what is
> underneath. Maybe that’s what they do at matchmakers [sic] in India…I
> don’t know.

Though this is a direct example of remediation, in which the role of the
astrologer has been digitized onto a matrimonial site. The role of the
astrologer was one that was seen as irrelevant for the kinds of pursuits
our subjects were engaged in.

People dedicating themselves to matchmaking were rarely mentioned as
specific actors in the courtship practices of those interviewed. When
asked about how sites could better meet their own specific needs,
Participant 10 wished that the role of a human matchmaker was more a
part of the websites he used,

> I think someone from the website should interview new members and take
> notes to get to know a person...almost like a coverage person for
> them. I envision it being someone who doesn’t keep in touch with you
> but someone that covers your profile. They would have a brief
> conversation with you when you join the site or at the period of time
> you request just to get a sense of who you are. Maybe they could even
> record a Q&A and then put it on the profile with the customer’s
> approval. And that person through other conversations could match up
> people rather than just relying on an algorithm. I know there are
> people in real life that do this. I like the big audience of Match,
> they would have to have someone to do it for a specialized group which
> is a high cost but also a smaller pool. Like in the traditional sense
> like an Indian matchmaker. I know this would cost more but augmenting
> the site with humans would result in more matches. Websites should be
> merely for introduction and they shouldn’t position themselves as a
> wedding connector basically. [emphasis added]

Later on, this subject said that he did not fill out the horoscope
portions of the site because “he didn’t place weight on [it].” Though
his courtship pursuits have been mediated by matrimonial sites and
dating sites such as Match.com, OkCupid.com, and eHarmony.com,
Participant 10 sees value in the role of the human matchmaker,
especially when compared to the social recommendation algorithms that
push certain profiles to users on dating and matrimonial sites. To
compensate for the ways that the sites did not completely correspond
with the ways he wanted to find eligibles, Participant 10 noted a number
of ways that he could become attractive to other users: he would write
more when responding to questions, be more active on sites that allow
one to write more, fill out as much as he found relevant in profiles,
and used keywords that could help users and algorithms find him amongst
the other profiles. So while he was submitting to the dating and
matrimonial sites, he was more excited about the possibilities of
human-mediated matchmaking. To make up for this incongruence, he tried
to anticipate the structures of the matching algorithms and “game” the
system so that his profile would be shown to as many other eligibles as
possible.

The matchmaking algorithm and the mediated nature of dating and
matrimonial sites were carefully considered by our subjects. Participant
8 also spoke about her discomfort with matchmaking algorithms, though in
her case, she was more resistant to the idea of recommending in general.

> I didn’t find it helpful to be on
> [eHarmony](http://eHarmony.com) because it didn’t let you
> search yourself. They give you options. I guess it’s like
> computerized. You fill out a huge profile and depending on what score
> you get they will match you with guys that would be compatible with
> you. So you can’t necessarily go through and filter. I don’t think. I
> didn’t give myself too much time on there. I found it irritating
> because they select guys for you. I didn’t let my mom do that. A
> majority of the times it didn’t even make sense...like how did they
> come up with this? Why would they think I would be compatible with
> this guy? [Emphasis added.]

In her case, Participant 8 did not welcome recommendations from
eHarmony, but also mentioned that she would feel uncomfortable if her
mother did that for her. So Participant 8 was uncomfortable with the
whole matchmaking apparatus, no matter how it was carried out. She was
aware of the various actors availing themselves to her, but she resisted
– or wished to resist – their offers because they did not give her the
agency to do the searching herself.

Participant 6 also saw their use of matrimonial sites in relationship to
the ability of their parents to match them. But she joined Shaadi.com
and Bharatmatrimony.com when she decided she should “settle down.” She
noted,

> Since I was young, it has been instilled in me that I am to, to marry
> a Sindhi [a regional ethnicity] man one day. I was actively involved
> in the Sindhi community back in 2007, but completely lost touch after
> I graduated college and got a job. My parents aren’t as involved in
> the community, either. So I figured joining matrimonial websites which
> has Sindhi men would make my search easier.

Participant 6 was eager to fulfill her culturally mandated role to find
a man of her regional ethnicity, but her parents were not involved
enough in the cultural networks to help serve the role as a matchmaker.
Recognizing this fact, she has become a part of the networks on two
sites in order to fulfill the desire to find a Sindhi partner despite
the fact that it would be difficult for her parents to find someone with
whom to arrange her.

Though all subjects talked about the sites from the perspective of
managing the sites for themselves, one subject, Participant 1, did admit
that his friends set up most of his profiles for him and then
relinquished control to him. The use of matrimonial sites by family
members became a factor in our subjects’ use of matrimonial sites.
Several subjects mentioned stories of encountering the parents and
family members of other users who contacted them for the eligible. These
contacts with parents were usually framed as undesirable interactions
with eligibles on the subcontinent. Participant 2, in explaining her
preference for a site that had more diasporic South Asians as opposed to
Indian nationals, noted about one South Asian site, “I felt that
Shaadi.com was not about people speaking about their personality and
what makes them happy. It was more like people’s parents looking to
marry off their kids.”

Several subjects who are members of Shaadi.com, which uses phone numbers
to verify accounts and makes those numbers public at first by default,
explained that they received calls from India. Not only were they not
interested in pursuing relationships with Indian nationals, but they
were extra turned off by the idea of dealing with someone other than the
eligible him or herself. Take, for instance, the experience of
Participant 1:

> I even put my phone number on there and there was like a bad awkward
> experience. Some girl’s dad called me 6 times and left messages saying
> call back...blah blah. It was weird. Maybe I shouldn’t have put my
> phone number. Going from not talking to anybody to straight up giving
> you calls and leaving you messages. I had never spoken to her or
> anything. But a lot of the profiles on Shaadi.com are created by
> siblings, parents, friends. That’s the other part about Shaadi. There
> are a lot of parents that put up profiles for their kids and it
> clearly says, “profile created by.” So you know if it was created by
> the parent or the person themselves, or a sibling, or something like
> that.

Participant 10 expressed a discomfort with not knowing who was behind
the profile. He says, “The South Asian one, Shaadi, I’ve tried off and
on over the last couple years. You really don’t know who is on the other
side. It could be a sibling, a parent, friends…”

While users knew that the South Asian sites were often used by family
member actors and that was not particularly attractive, the use of these
sites was still attractive for some reasons.

Finally, those subjects who were less serious about the pursuit of a
spouse came to dating sties and, somewhat awkwardly or reluctantly, to
matrimonial sites with a particular perspective on these sites as
actors. Participant 5 explained her preference for dating sites by
saying, “Shaadi's name says it all. It's about marriage. If you talk to
someone on there, you are only talking to them because you want to get
married. That feels desperate. At least on sites like OkCupid.com, it's
not as serious. It's about dating..."

Participant 1 felt that there was a spectrum, and he was looking for
something just right. He starts by echoing Participant 5,

> Shaadi.com is very hard core serious. The name says it... you know.
> It's the seriousness of it about finding a life partner. Indiandating
> seemed less hardcore so I thought I would check that out. Indiandating
> was a bit too much though. I wasn’t on there for very long but from
> what I heard from other folks it was just a hook up site. It wasn’t
> serious at all. And so the quality of people on there wasn’t so great.

Our subjects, who all knew well their options and the traditions
associated with arranged, assisted, and love marriages as well as
dating, see their use of sites in relation to their pursuit of one of
these options or a hybrid of them. No one found that any one site was
the perfect structure to pursue the courtship they were seeking, but
many were aware of how certain attributes of certain sites did or did
not correspond to their desires.

In this section, we have noted the ways in which the remediation of
certain social and non-social actors that could be seen as providing a
matchmaking function played a role in our subjects’ preference for or
thoughts on various sites. In the next section, we will look at the
remediation of a tool – the biodata – in the pursuit of courtship.

## Remediating Biodata

For those who are specifically designated as a matchmaker, one crucial
tool to maintain a repository of eligibles is the biodata. Biodata allow
matchmakers to keep track of the people who they are working with to
find matches. Biodata fill the matchmakers’ database. These one-page
entries, when used by professional matchmakers, are tools for mediating
the process of arrangement. Whereas some arranged and assisted marriage
connections are made by family or social ties that are made solely with
the agency of the eligibles and/or their parents or other family
members, biodata are a medium that are necessitated only by the presence
of a separate matchmaker. They are a technology of the matchmaker.

> Biodata vary in format, layout and style. Still, the characteristics
> most commonly mentioned are date of birth, caste, religion, education,
> occupation, income, height, weight, complexion, accomplishments,
> family status, personal interests, conditions of marriage, and partner
> expectations. Most profiles are accompanied by a photograph either in
> the body of the biodata or as a separate attachment.[^10_Raja-Renninger_27]

The awareness of our subjects with these forms of courtship and this
technology came up implicitly and explicitly throughout our interviews.

Because the biodata form is tied to traditional modes of courtship or
arrangement, diasporic South Asians, unlike members of some other
ethnicities in the American context, have long faced the model of tying
the act of representing oneself in terms of numbers, categories, and
words, to courtship. It was surprising to find out, then, that many of
the subjects in this study expressed discomfort at filling out the forms
on various dating and matrimonial sites. While subjects like Participant
10 (above) found it important to use many of the fields on dating and
matrimonial sites strategically, many of the users were using other
modes of matchmaking to get away from the strictures of a technology
like the biodata and a process like traditional matchmaking.

Participant 7, who was not only interested in South Asian eligibles[^10_Raja-Renninger_28]
spoke about her preference for online platforms that created
opportunities to pursue dates based on mutual interest expressed
quickly, such as Tinder, or through a group date, facilitated by
Grouper. After speaking about these models, she said,

> I would feel better about meeting someone like that rather than on
> Shaadi.com where it feels like a business deal. I feel like other
> sites provide other areas you can explore rather than the traditional
> Indian criteria of finding someone. If I wanted that I would create a
> biodata and have my parents pass it around and maybe not even need to
> go on Shaadi. But I want more than that.

The models of matching that Participant 7 expressed interest in were not
incredibly tied to presenting intense amounts of data. Both examples she
presented as positive options require very little to be provided, and
she specifically resisted the idea of biodata as appropriate ways of
presenting oneself to potential suitors. In this case, though she is
mostly interested in a South Asian-American, she is most interested in
models of courtship that are not remediations of “traditional” South
Asian modes.

When asked how she felt about the various sites she used, Participant 2
noted,

> Well, obviously, any software package is going to try and make a
> digital representation of the real world. And it’s only going to do it
> so accurately…I feel like eHarmony was the best because it brought the
> personality dimension into it rather than just the biodata…I think
> people are busy so there may be a better match for you out there,
> but...people can get inundated. A part of it is a little dehumanizing.
> You are taking something that is inherently emotional and channeling
> it through a machine. These are real human beings. You may connect
> with somebody, and it could be a spark, but it could be a one sided
> spark, but to the machine it doesn’t take into an account that
> somebody is damaged in the process.

Here Participant 2 puts the biodata in its context, as a tool of
matchmaking, and notes that the software that each site runs uses
different protocols for using the biodata-like profile. Though she
doesn’t mention the roles of human matchmakers, she implies that certain
algorithms and software can be more humane.

Finally, Participant 1 brought up the ways that Shaadi.com’s profiles
mirrored the kinds of information that went into biodata. This was seen
as unattractive to him as a user. When asked why Shaadi.com’s structure
was not attractive to him, “too traditional,” he said,

> It was more bio-data-ish. Stuff that you would put on a biodata. Like
> some of the standard stuff is like you know, height, weight and skin

Here, the structure of the online sites’ structures were seen as
comparable but favorable to biodata. This last comment brings up
directly the idea of different uses of the site for diasporic subjects
as compared to the use of sites by Indian nationals. No matter how much
skin tone might become a part of mate selection in the American context,
articulating this is seen to go against the social practices of a
post-racial American culture. In the next section, we will discuss the
remediation of diasporic identity with regards to the sites that our
subjects used.

## Remediating Diasporic Subjectivity

The concepts of ethnoscapes, technoscapes, and mediascapes remind us
that in the contemporary era, the nation-state becomes a less compelling
way to organize culture. By characterizing the contemporary shape of
culture as -*scapes*, Appadurai brings attention to the ways that the
relationships between people, nation-states, and cultures of tradition
are inconsistent but shaped by a series of forces that constitute the
transnational flows of people, technology, and media, for instance.
[^10_Raja-Renninger_29] The diasporic subjects in this study have all made a home for
themselves in the United States, specifically in the New York City area
in New York and New Jersey. Though it was not necessarily a surprise
that the subjects considered sites that both do and do not market
themselves specifically to the South Asian diasporic communities, we
were surprised by the various ways that our subjects justified the sites
that they used, especially as those justifications pertained to one’s
pursuit of a suitor that fitted within a specific set of constraints.

While all respondents considered both South Asian diasporic and
multiethnic sites, most of them used some of both. For the most part,
the subjects expressed a desire to browse or search South Asian-American
eligibles. Many of our subjects mentioned their tactics for finding
appropriate eligibles on a number of sites. On multiethnic sites
targeted towards Americans, they spoke specifically about tactics to
find other South Asians. To do this, users often used sites where they
could sort through profiles by ethnicity. Ethnicity is also often listed
on profiles on dating and matrimonial sites. The category South Asian,
it turns out, isn’t particularly universally legible as a standard. On
some sites, “South Asian” was a category. On sites where “Asian” was a
category, but not “South Asian,” those looking for Hindu eligibles were
able to narrow down their search results by using both the ethnicity and
religion fields. On still other sites, “East Indian” was the particular
designation that users needed to use.

Another theme that arose throughout our interviews was the ways in which
sites for South Asian users did not meet the needs of the diasporic
subjects, and rather were too targeted towards users on the
subcontinent. Without prompting, several of the subjects we interviewed
specifically stated that they were not interested in the prospects of
meeting someone living in India. Participant 1 noted, “They ask if you
wanted to put your income or if you wanted to put HIV status, or your
citizenship status. I don’t know. It felt like it was very much geared
towards folks overseas.” Here, Participant 1 noted that the citizenship
status felt out of place considering his own priorities, because he
wanted to find eligibles who lived nearby and implied that a field for
HIV status was unexpected and felt out-of-place. [^10_Raja-Renninger_30]

Many participants who were looking for South Asian-American mates were
interested specifically in people with specific regional ethnic or
religious identities, like Participant 6 above. For these subjects,
membership in a site designed specifically for intra-group marriage was
a part of the user’s repertoire of sites used. Often this was a spin-off
of BharatMatrimony.com for specific ethnic groups, but sometimes it was
a specific matrimonial site for a religious group. In one case, a
subject used a small, elite secret site for members with a specific
regional, ethnic and caste intersection. These examples show how
affiliations specific to culture on the subcontinent are still important
for the diasporic subjects.

The pursuit of diasporic South Asians specifically was strategized in a
number of ways. Participant 7 articulated a common desire to pursue
courtship with South Asian-Americans by talking about her justifications
for not using Shaadi.com seriously.

> Because I’m under the impression that most of the people on Shaadi.com
> are from India and I’m not sure if...I guess I’m under the impression
> that most of the people live in India and I’m not open to doing
> anything long distance. I’m not really interested in...anything that
> complicated. And different samajes[^10_Raja-Renninger_31] and associations have their
> own private sites, I think. I’m more interested in something close by…
> Somebody that was brought up in a similar Indian and American culture
> here would be a nice starting point…

Further contextualizing her earlier desire to avoid the transactional
nature of Shaadi.com (above), she continued,

> But I’m also not going to just limit myself to Indians and that’s what
> Shaadi.com does. If you’re Indian and are serious to get
> married...like right away, and only want another Indian, then you go
> to that site. I’m not into just meeting someone to talk about “shaadi”
> so I don’t think I’m the right person to be on Shaadi.

Here, Participant 7 noted the specific reasons for preferring the
American-targeted multiethnic sites and emphasized her diasporic
subjectivity as something that is best addressed by these sites.

Like Participant 7’s observation that encountering others who are
Indian-American would be a “nice starting point,” others expressed a
desire to pursue relationships with other Indian-Americans exclusively.
Participant 8 also discussed her desire for a specific mix of Indian and
Indian-American:

> [I’m not so into Shaadi, because] there are a lot of men on there that
> are not citizens and not [my] type. I *dunno*. It’s just guys I would
> never be interested in. And citizenship is definitely a big thing.
> That’s why I rely on Match.com more. It’s more Americanized guys that
> do have that Indian culture, too. That’s what I’m looking for -
> someone like me. But with Shaadi.com it could get a little more...I
> don’t know how to say the right word, but...*desi* I guess.

In this regard, Participant 8 echoed a sentiment expressed or assumed by
many of our subjects: for a number of reasons, another South
Asian-American was what they were using matchmaking technologies to
find. These desires were articulated through the various technological
and human actors surrounding these subjects.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the use of dating and matrimonial
sites by South Asian-Americans in the New York City metro area. In so
doing, we have noted the ways that the various human and non-human
actors in “traditional” matchmaking processes have been remediated, as
have the tools involved in mediated matchmaking, and the users’ own
diasporic identities and subjectivities. Understanding South Asian
marriage as all about matchmaking and courtship and American/Western
marriage as solely invested in the pursuit of love, dating, and/or sex,
one simplifies the ways that modernity is actually experienced, and the
many possibilities that modern or contemporary subjects engage in.

While modernity affords “the pure relationship,” an equitable one that
is based on the affinity for two people for each other or the loss of
interest in each other, which leads Giddens to advocate for the no-fault
divorce, human beings blind ourselves to other systems of relating other
than “love.”[^10_Raja-Renninger_32] Or, alternatively, we limit our definition of “love.”
Instances of mediated matchmaking lay bare the technologized and
mediated pursuit of courtship and its complicity in models of
arrangement, assisted marriages, and, in fact, love. Diasporic
subjectivity, as described in this essay, is a particularly interesting
boundary object that points out the ways that various modes of relating
are coeval in a contemporary globalized world. In considering the
experiences of diasporic South Asians’ use of dating and matrimonial
sites to pursue relationships, we are reminded of the various courses
and pathways enabled by transnational ethno-, techno-, and mediascapes.
As courts, legislatures, social scientists, and culture at large attempt
to codify certain modes of marriage and courtship within the United
States and other nations, it is helpful to be reminded of the many
coexisting and varied models for these modes of relating.
