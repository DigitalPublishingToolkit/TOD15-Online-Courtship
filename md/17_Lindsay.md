Abstract: Computer mediated interpersonal interactions are defining our daily lives as we know it. Studying this phenomenon with various methodologies, across different cultures and traditions is a crucial component in understanding social ties. This book brings together articles that approach online dating from a  range of cultural and critical perspectives. 
The research decodes the approach to online dating in various countries like France, India, China, Turkey, Cuba, USA and Portugal. Mapping the history of dating and courtship shows the evolution of these practices even before the introduction of the online medium and traces parallels and differences between old and new traditions.

# Performative Acts of Gender in Online Dating: An Auto-ethnography Comparing Sites

### Megan Lindsay

## Introduction

Last year, one in ten Americans reported using online dating; I am one
of these many users.[^17_Lindsay_1] Dating websites are intended to mediate a space
for meeting new people and provide access to a dating market.[^17_Lindsay_2] The
site’s culture and design offer suggestions about how to find a partner
through optimal dating presentation. In turn the site subtly suggest
ways to construct a personal identity, including gender presentation.
When I participated in online dating, I struggled with how to present my
identity authentically to another person through online interactions.
Specifically, how could I shape my dating profile to represent a virtual
extension of myself? I hypothesize, describe, and reflect on how a woman
can present herself as a feminist in a manner that avoids the stigma
associated with the term, through autoethnographic methods. In fact,
many women do not associate with the term “feminist,” and I ultimately
conclude that creating an authentic personality using online dating
websites is difficult and dehumanizing for men and women based on
restrictive traditional gender performances. When asking Internet users
what they think of online dating the approval rate steadily continues to
improve.[^17_Lindsay_1] In the future, we can expect the number of online daters to
continue to increase.

Dating courtships have been complicated both by the changing roles of
women and men and by the new approaches afforded by
technology.[^17_Lindsay_3] [^17_Lindsay_4] [^17_Lindsay_5] It should be the responsibility of both
men and women to negotiate the new possibilities (specifically new norms
and expectations around courtship) afforded in dating relationships,
“but the media would certainly have us think that . . . women must
figure it out before we end up desperate and alone”.[^17_Lindsay_5] To add to the
complication, online dating sites, despite their potentially alternative
media form, further perpetuate a traditional view of love and romance.
The websites present narrow examples of user narratives that fit what
finding love should be and how people should act, rhetoric being used
would have daters believe they should present themselves as well-behaved characters
in a romantic comedy. This paper is intended to be an informative
recounting of my experience trying to present an authentic identity
while using online dating for the first time. This paper theorizes about
the role of corporate dating site owners and the existing platform
constraints/affordances that are shaping identity for heterosexual
dating experiences. In applying the work of Judith Butler[^17_Lindsay_6], the
performative acts of gender will be considered both in my personal
process and choices and in the way that online dating sites encouraged
me to behave. What began as a study of “objective” observations of the
pedagogical aspects of dating websites, particularly Match.com and
Okcupid.com, evolved into a weaving of my own personal story about the
informal learning that happens in these spaces. While autoethnography is
a less traditional method, using my own experiences and observations
from participating in several online dating sites was selected as an
ethical approach for respecting others’ online dating experiences and
provided a great deal of information.[^17_Lindsay_7],[^17_Lindsay_8],[^17_Lindsay_9] I will use
reflexive practices to examine how popular commercial dating sites play
a pivotal role in shaping and re-shaping my online identity choices.

Previously research has shown that heteronormative culture and
traditional gender roles are pervasive in the online dating experience.
A content analysis of a Canadian dating site showed men and women have
overlapping interests regarding a potential partners character
qualities, such as morality and passion, were frequently mentioned by
both men and women.[^17_Lindsay_10] Some male profiles emphasized certain masculine
qualities that were less traditional; presenting a new more polished
modern man who was in touch with certain aspects of his own
femininity.[^17_Lindsay_10] Yet, the men’s profiles did not abandon all tradition
and certain qualities, especially work and the ability to provide, were
highlighted in the virtual self. Women’s profiles that were analyzed
also performed gender scripts to a degree; certain profiles mentioned
sexuality but in an illusive way, in contrast the male profiles more
explicitly talked about sex. Women online who were older than 40, and
looking for a partner, emphasized romance and waiting for the right
person to be physically intimate with.[^17_Lindsay_11] Several studies demonstrate
that while individuals may show nuance, more often than not, familiar
gender performances are used for constructing virtual selves.
[^17_Lindsay_3],[^17_Lindsay_4],[^17_Lindsay_10],[^17_Lindsay_11]

Contemporary dating relationships provide individuals’ an opportunity to
personally define relationship needs and seek partners according to
these needs.[^17_Lindsay_12] Previous research documents that the combination of
casual and loosely defined relationships, with the onset of online
dating and personal advertisements in print newspapers, lead to a dating
industry. [^17_Lindsay_13] The dating industry helps people become objects or
products within the dating space, “Science and commerce are entwined in
the relationship-scientific endeavors of these \[online dating\]
organizations.”[^17_Lindsay_13] Before online dating began men and women would use
print advertisements to market themselves in order to entice other
singles.[^17_Lindsay_14] In Jagger’s content analysis of dating newspaper
advertisements she concludes this is consumerism at work, and to be
marketable as a dater one many daters relied on mentioning their
physical attractiveness and likability.[^17_Lindsay_14] In the conclusion Jagger
describes how gender performances remain present, but are being
redefined based on new masculinities and femininities.[^17_Lindsay_14] Daters must
present themselves as attractive products, and identify a target
market.[^17_Lindsay_14] In an experiment by Yang and Chiou, adolescents’ were asked
to select dating preferences off a checklist; then the participants were
given an opportunity to scroll through potential dates online. The
results demonstrated that the more options available, the more young
people would become distracted and abandon their original
preferences.[^17_Lindsay_15] The medium of online advertisements could potentially
influence daters’ rational dating process, making it increasingly
difficult to stand out among other daters. Based on previous online
dating literature many individuals’ perform heterosexual gendered
scripts, potentially to attract a target audience. Using autoethnography
to describe the online dating experience from the perspective of the
dater I will discuss at length how I navigated these
spaces.[^17_Lindsay_3],[^17_Lindsay_4],[^17_Lindsay_9],[^17_Lindsay_10],[^17_Lindsay_11]

## Methodology

The analyses and information offered in this auto-ethnography are based
on my experiences as an online dater as interpreted using Foucault’s
discourse analysis theory. [^17_Lindsay_16] Foucault describes how large
institutions create predefined roles, and members of the institution
select a role they associate with while a member of the institution.
Thus, the “institution” defines the roles in order to maintain a
position of power over individuals, yet those individuals believe they
are creating a unique and individual representation of themselves.[^17_Lindsay_17]
Applying Foucault’s theory, I will attempt to determine if users can
create an individual and complex identity within the sponsoring site’s
structure. I will focus particularly on whether a site’s pedagogy
inhibits individuals’ from establishing a nuanced gender identity by
limiting their responses to an abstract assortment of predetermined
roles.

During the first phase of the discourse analysis, I will analyze the
content of the websites based on the “site of the image” as well as the
“textual materials, both visual and written.” [^17_Lindsay_16] Although it may seem
that using one technique or methodology may offer a clearer
understanding, the complexity of the sites requires using both methods.
When setting up a dating profile, there are specific templates provided
for users to create a unique dating profile. I will examine these
templates to determine what the site defines as necessary dating
information. This examination will be useful in identifying how the
website shapes a user’s dating experience and how gender roles are
integrated into the site’s structure. The visual context and culture of
the Internet is different than traditional media; “users of the Internet
collaboratively produce digital images of the body – very particular
things for very particular uses – in the context of racial and gender
identity formation”.[^17_Lindsay_18] This analysis will demonstrate how my
individual experience was a constant interplay between the institution
of commercial dating sites and user-created material.[^17_Lindsay_4] It will detail
how web designers create the choices that its users may select to
individualize their online personality. This process of interactivity
between user and creator sets Internet studies apart from traditional
media studies.[^17_Lindsay_18]

The second portion of the discourse analysis will seek to explain how
“the institution\[s\] put\[s\] images to work,” and the dating site
users hold up the websites expectations. [^17_Lindsay_16] Images are a powerful way
to promote a message. An institution can promote certain types of images
to present an idea to its members. In this way, the site is used to
promote an idea. A site, however, may also reinforce to its users ways
to conform to an idea (e.g., attractive bodies). This can be seen where
dating sites allow user to select only predetermined body types. Fuchs
calls this a socio-technological space where institutions recreate the
societal norms where its online members exist.[^17_Lindsay_19] I will analyze the
choices commercial dating sites offer users to find whether the site has
greater power when creating the experience, or, conversely, whether
users create their own experience within the site. I will use
reflexivity to discuss my experiences dating online and demonstrate how
gender matters and corporate institutions now facilitating dating
markets shape identity possibilities. Further, the shaping of this
process can influence the ways individuals interact during first
encounters with potential partners.

Lastly, throughout this paper I plan to use reflexivity. In discussion
of the relevance of previous research findings, I will analyze my
experiences participating in online dating. Previous research describes
what reflexivity is and why we may use it: “The ability of humans to
reflect (on the past and the future) has a long intellectual history and
heritage growing out of Enlightenment belief in the ability of (wo)man
to reason in a reasonable manner about his(her) fate, impact the future,
and transcend the present”[^17_Lindsay_20] In order to demonstrate how the sites
interact with the users, I will discuss my dating experience using both
Okcupid, and Match.com. The use of ethnographic methods in virtual
worlds is useful because it can “explore beliefs and practices within
and between cultures, linking together materials…“[^17_Lindsay_9]

I did receive approval from my institution’s IRB before creating a faux
profile to make observations about how Match.com and Okcupid operates
and communicates with members. My “research profile” informed users I
was observing the site and encouraged users to contact me if they had
questions or concerns. No users contacted my research profile. I then
decided to research the site as a consumer of its product instead of
making inferences about other individuals’ experiences. The examples
given are based on my experiences. Ethnography methods commonly present
“key critical cases, incidents, stories, or events to illustrate
patterns”[^17_Lindsay_9]. The description is intended to resonate the cultural
experience of online dating rather than give a factual accounting of
individual behaviors.[^17_Lindsay_7],[^17_Lindsay_8] “We must take into consideration possible
harm or embarrassment that can be brought about through romantic,
sexual, and intimate activities.” [^17_Lindsay_9] While I considered doing
interviews and providing information from others’ profiles as part of
the data within the paper, this practice seemed deceptive since I knew
during the early phases of my research that I was on both sites as a
researcher and as a dater. For this reason, specific examples are
fictionalized to protect the privacy of other daters with whom I had
interactions. This protection is two fold; first, I intend to reshape
certain phrases and words so that in an era of search engines no other
daters’ information could be directly linked back to them. Secondly, I
believe most interactions unfolded as a sincere and honest attempt to
reach out to me as a dater and not as a researcher. To unveil these
potentially intimate moments word-for-word felt like a breach of ethics
as a researcher.

## Attracting an Audience

Standard features found on dating sites include an original profile
where individuals can display content including pictures, and a short
text description about themselves. On both Match.com and Okcupid, daters
have multiple ways for interacting through the site. These include less
direct methods meant to seem more like gestures, such as the wink on
Match, or adding someone to a list of favorite users on Okcupid.
Additionally, users can email and direct message one another when logged
onto the site. After a short period of using Match.com, I quickly
noticed several fields on my profile providing a numbers report.
Emphasis on these statistics showed the site had a vested interest in
attracting users and site traffic over helping individuals finding a
life partner. The website consistently encouraged my participation, by
reminding me to check, update, and attend to my profile. The faux
research profile I had created received several notifications; between
March 27th and May 9th, the site generated 68 emails, an average of two
per day, encouraging my participation even though I rarely logged in and
no other daters had contacted me. The emails suggested “potential
matches” and encouraged me to contact them. Love, it seemed, was
available only for the most active users. But the constant suggestion to
look more, click more, and send more messages is dangerous. Men may feel
justified in unwanted pursuit, and women, who are traditionally
encouraged to be submissive, may have a difficult time stopping unwanted
communications.[^17_Lindsay_6] Further, the activity of flipping through profiles
became exciting and fun, but I was unsure if it was helping me narrow
down my dating pool. If anything the longer I was spending collecting
potential profiles, the broader the range on my spectrum of dates.[^17_Lindsay_15]

To the websites credit, knowing I was female, I was encouraged to reach
out and contact potential dates. I hesitated to do this, believing that
men still have an expectation of making first contact. When engaging in
a site specifically designed to (re)create dating opportunities, I felt
it necessary to craft an image that was at least moderately compliant
with gender norms. Match.com, knowing prevailing cultural dating
practices, was “offering available norms for the act of recognition.”
[^17_Lindsay_21] Match.com never stated explicitly on the website when a wink
should be used, but a mediating flirt option seems to be a convenient
way for women to indicate interest without seeming aggressive. People
would take this interaction as the first step towards flirtation.
Viewing profiles became the catalyst for more user interaction, and even
though I did not send a wink first, some men communicated with me simply
because I had viewed their profile. After viewing a profile, I would
often receive a wink from the user. Then I would wink back, and a
conversation would ensue. This reincarnation of traditional dating
pursuits affirms that in the online world, many men still felt
comfortable in their role as initiators.

Similar to Match.com, OKcupid.com reported the number of viewers I had
on my page each day, which told me the number of people interested
enough in my picture to click to my page. Every time I logged into these
sites, it was difficult not to view these numbers as a report of my
success. During my youth, I can recount numerous occasions where young
men described how they ranked women. The woman became an object in this
rating game, an exercise in who deserves a man’s attention. The higher
the number, the more desirable she was considered. In the 11th grade,
Shane told me that on a scale of one to ten, I was a “six” because I
wore my hair short, and my chest was too small. My anxiety about “low
numbers” was fostered from an awareness that my ability to find a
partner was hinging on my ability to compete with other women, and
again, here was my score right in front of me. According to the site,
this is how the world of dating goes for everybody. As stated upfront in
one Okcupid.com blog, “we all know that beautiful people are more
successful daters”[^17_Lindsay_22] However, different from men, women at a much
earlier age internalize the messages that their inherent value to other
people comes first from their attractiveness and their ability to secure
a partner.[^17_Lindsay_23] Men do have to compete based on looks; yet just based on
the use of women’s modeling photo’s or professional pictures as their
dating profile icon, my impression was their pressure did not come with
the same intensity.

The numbers game elicited different emotional responses. Some days, I
had many views, and I felt validated and attractive. Other days, I felt
insecure and uncertain about my attractiveness, because I had received
no messages. To win at the numbers game, I found myself spending more
time on both sites, frequently checking my winks, watching for new
messages, and viewing more profiles. I became easily distracted by the
prospect of being datable or likeable for an audience rather than a
partner. Nowhere on either site does it suggest that less is more or
that narrowing down your potential daters will benefit you. Rather than
emphasize certain attributes that make me stand out as an individual,
generating high volumes of traffic meant presenting a commodified
pleasurable package of myself. My online self became a product, not a
person.

## Marketing Tools

Both Match.com and Okcupid.com provided information that instructed
daters on different ways to present themselves. Match.com has an “advice
center” that gives direction on how to write the perfect first email,
pick out the perfect outfit, be sensual on the first date, and win
anyone over. To illustrate, according to Match.com, to write the perfect
email: 1) keep it simple, 2) be honest, 3) mention something specific
from the person’s profile, 4) let your voice come through, 5) have fun
with the format, and 6) check your spelling. However, daters should not:
1) focus on your match’s looks, 2) go on and on via email, 3) ask too
many questions, 4) use edgy humor, 5) send multiple users the same
message, or 6) rely on sexual innuendo. Essentially the site attempts to
teach people to be polite and avoid taking risks. According to online
dating presenting risks, such as edgy humor, may mean no dates. Based on
the sites advice I assumed the objective was not to help other daters
rule you out based on differences, or a clear mismatch, but to subdue
off-putting characteristics so that potentially more users could relate
to you.

Match.com also promotes certain dating behaviors with its online
magazine, “Happen.” [^17_Lindsay_24] Just as it is stated in the slogan, “because
love doesn’t come with instructions,” is telling, The magazine includes
articles such as:

-   “8 things that make women crave sex”

-   “Dating when you are a parent”

-   “6 bad traits that make him a good partner”

-   “7 text messages that scare men off”

-   “Women’s 5 biggest dating lies”

The magazine reinforced the notion that there were limitless
opportunities for a social connection, and if I failed at love, I must
have done something wrong. As another example, in the article “Women’s 5
biggest dating lies,” women are berated for having low self-esteem.
“Sure, it’s normal to have a few negative thoughts (which Ahlers\[life
couch\] refers to as “Big Fat Lies”) while you’re dating, but what’s not
OK is allowing that mindset to prevent you from finding real, true love.
According to the online life coach, women should simply stop any
negative self-talk because it prevents us from dating.[^17_Lindsay_25] The article
never mentions where self-doubt comes from, or how consumerism and
gendered scripts being reiterated through the site may contribute to
feelings of inadequacy. The article asks women to question their inner
critic (e.g., “too fat compared to whom?”). Additionally, the article
never addresses the website’s role of mediating the dating space.
Instead, all responsibility for success or failure was squarely placed
on my shoulders. It seems Match.com perpetuated an overarching message:
love is for all people, and if you market your online profile just
right, you too can find love.

Okcupid.com matches potential daters according to test results. The site
informs users that it will “do the math” as you look for a partner.
Additionally, Okcupid.com offers many blog entries where general trends
are presented as info-graphics, charts, and quantified information. At
the bottom of the homepage, the OkTrends section reports on a number of
topics, similar to Match.com’s online magazine.[^17_Lindsay_26]The content is
comparable; “Don’t be ugly by accident,” and “Exactly what to say in a
first message” instruct users on what tone to use when writing and how
to pick the best image for their profile picture. Okcupid.com attempts
to use a casual, humorous tone, which suggests their willingness to help
a user find whatever they are looking for at the moment. For example,
one blog discusses the sexual trends of site users while creating the
impression the writer is a friend, and the two of you are having a
conversation. [^17_Lindsay_26]

Okcupid.com emphasizes being matched based on the quantified and tested
attributes of our personality. The site offers several tests, some of
which are traditional psychological metrics meant to capture personality
while others are more playful. This is not a unique feature of
Okcupid.com; other dating sites promote their ability to help you make
the right match using algorithms.[^17_Lindsay_13] The claimed magic of the site is
it can match you based on science, which implies love is based on a
formula or algorithm. If the users have a successful relationship, it
supports the rhetoric; love is logic. Historically, relying on math,
abstract logic, and traditional sciences has been categorized as male in
nature and superior to female ways of knowing. [^17_Lindsay_27] Okcupid.com’s
discourse has a subtle but powerful implication; don’t rely on your
intuition or heart. Use logic, science, and authority for best results
during online dating.

An interesting feature found only on Okcupid.com is the use of
crowdsourcing. As previously mentioned, site members can upload their
own tests to the website, giving other daters an opportunity to measure
features not covered by the tests offered on the site. Users can also
submit photos to “My Best Face,” a program that allows daters to rate
the attractiveness of other users’ photographs. Crowdsourcing acts, such
as My Best Face, are a perfect example of how online dating can
construct online spaces in conjunction with the designers. [^17_Lindsay_19]
Previously, researchers have demonstrated how commercial images are so
common place in our day-to-day lives, that often times individuals’
mimic or recreate the images on their one. [^17_Lindsay_28]Despite the opportunity
for freedom of expression, users’ ranking patterns matched those images
which are typically considered commercially attractive.[^17_Lindsay_28] Recently,
WIRED magazine was given permission by Okcupid.com and Match.com to use
their data and determine, on average, what attracts daters. For
heterosexual daters, both men and women prioritized a flat stomach above
all else. [^17_Lindsay_29] Eventually I came to understand that if I wanted to
attract a dater, my physique was the most important thing.

Online dating culture is influenced by the coproduction of knowledge
through the site as well as broader society; each individual profile
actively shapes and conforms to the culture.[^17_Lindsay_19] Men and women seem to
rely on the social context of the site to define gender roles and
self-presentation. This includes the visual culture, and that culture
still promotes the idea that a woman’s ultimate value is in her
looks.[^17_Lindsay_28] Match.com and Okcupid.com subtly promote bodies as
advertisements. A reoccurring advertisement on my page was for Weight
Watchers. The ad featured a petite blonde and, given my recent
understanding that my looks mattered most, suggested to me the idea that
“thin” is a desirable attribute. The message seemed clear. Consumer
culture emphasizes thin, small, docile bodies as a representation of
true femininity.[^17_Lindsay_28] Many men and women wanted a model like date, and in
order to find love, I should look like one, or so I was told.

Commercial dating sites promote the idea that it is not only convenient
to meet potential partners online; it is also common. Below are a list
of Match.com slogans and marketing, found on the website and through
television commercials. The first slogan reiterates that the
relationships start online, not during the in-person phase. Love is
guaranteed for any user. The promise of love for any user may not be
logical, but individuals are sold the idea that their existence, or at
least their happiness, it contingent on finding a partner. Form women
they may have received even stronger messages about how their self-worth
depends on that love, especially the love from a successful
hetero-man.[^17_Lindsay_6] Lastly, the slogans reinforce that online presentation
trump other factors involved in love. Finding a mate is about keeping a
fresh marketing approach, and even though the environment has changed,
your appearance is still a strong (perhaps the strongest) indicator of
your chances for love.

-   “1 in 5 relationships start online. And more of them start at Match
    than any other site.”

-   “Find Love. Guaranteed.”

-   “Your interests change, so should your profile.”

-   “Attract 15x more attention. Add a photo.”

Regarding performativity, the act of gender is not a role, it is a
series of acts. [^17_Lindsay_6] Thus, if the site or its users’ minimizes the
importance of a woman’s career, other users may begin to minimize their
career to remain an acceptable woman based on the standards of the
site.[^17_Lindsay_6] Since the site, and users who maintain the culture within the
site, strongly emphasize physical attractiveness, than the users are
best to invest their time in presenting a physically attractive self.
The culture and profile space provided limits individual expression and
reduces bodies to online advertisements. After spending my time immersed
in online dating sites I learned that the responsibility of creating and
maintaining a sense of self that is authentic is up to me, the user, and
the majority of getting to know other daters would happen in the real
world.

## Personal Marketing Strategy

When first creating my dating profile I looked to other users, and not
just the advice and features of the site, to better understand the
culture. I was unsure how I wanted to present myself to other daters.
Early on people speculated the Internet would allow individuals to
create a neutral space removed from the body and void of cultural
identities such as gender, race, and class.[^17_Lindsay_18] Yet, the internet has
evolved into a socio-technological extension of society where individual
identities are important. [^17_Lindsay_18],[^17_Lindsay_30] My initial expectations of the
sites were changes my observation of other users and the suggestions of
the dating sites. At first, it seemed best to present myself as
authentically as possible if I wanted to make an authentic connection. I
wanted to present a nuanced gender identity but worried that my message
would be misinterpreted. It was difficult to know if my choice to mute
certain aspects of my identity was a sell out of my personal values. [^17_Lindsay_6]
Before I even began to build my profile I already had certain
advantages, being young and white are both highly competitive in online
dating space.[^17_Lindsay_31] Would taking advantage of certain selling points,
attract the type of person I would really want to be with?

I reviewed other females’ profile to decide how I wanted to portray
myself. Just like real or offline dating, to some degree I would be
competing with other women, or at the very least our online
presentations would be compared.[^17_Lindsay_32] Some of the content I saw was
worth mimicking; such as offering a practical reason using the site i.e.
moving to a new city. Other portrayals seemed so cliché that they failed
to provide any sense of the person outside of their ability to perform
gender. Usernames like “ms.cherrypie” or “bubbleycutie” made me wonder
if these women chose youthful personas intentionally, or were these
women just doing what was needed in order to compete for attention in
the dating market? Other usernames hyper-sexualized a woman’s persona
such as “pullmyhair” or “bombasticblondie” or “vampirehottie”. There was
a wide range of usernames, but culture is influenced by these extreme
presentations of womanhood. I was having a hard time feelings like an
individual when some of the women seemed to be presenting identities
that positively reinforced the acting out of gendered scripts.[^17_Lindsay_6],[^17_Lindsay_11] I
chose an androgynous username, mlindsa3, because neutrality felt safer
than having every email message start with the line, ‘Hello naughty4you’
or ‘Hi sweety14’.

Another interest I had was related to the way in which women presented
careers, ambitions and goals.Match.com has an online dating community
where individuals presented traditional gender scripts such as
traditional pursuit or heteronormative family roles. Arguments made for
the “naturalness” of gendered identities are based in the perceived need
for society to create a proper family unit.[^17_Lindsay_6] Women in their
childbearing years are expected to publicly display and justify their
choices for reproduction.[^17_Lindsay_6],[^17_Lindsay_11] While not scientific, I tallied the
education preferences of fifty men and fifty women and noticed a telling
pattern. Men and women tended to emphasize traditional gender roles
within the structure of the family. For example, men commonly listed
their education but had no preference for their partner’s education.[^17_Lindsay_10]
Yet, women commonly preferred a partner with a higher education.[^17_Lindsay_10] I
began to wonder if my commitment to higher education was a disposable
quality to men, or at least something I should be clear would not
prevent me from prioritizing a family. Perhaps because the site forces
users to prioritize their preferences, my value was still measured
according to traditional roles for women, and I should strive to present
myself as a good wife and mother. Even online, it seemed men chose to
present themselves as the breadwinner, and women emphasized their
qualities as a homemaker. [^17_Lindsay_1],[^17_Lindsay_10],[^17_Lindsay_11]

My opening paragraph needed to be interesting and authentic but somehow
stand out among many profiles. “Reciprocity takes the form of
self-promotion. Culture is to become precisely nothing but advertising.”
[^17_Lindsay_33] I wondered if it was better to be cute or smart. Was there room in
the online dating world to be both? I consider my stubbornness,
independence, out-spoken nature, logic, and sarcastic sense of humor my
more masculine traits, and my more feminine traits are my kindness,
passion, and my nurturing nature. I am comfortable with these traits,
and I hope my partner has similar qualities. However, I felt certain if
I emphasized my masculine qualities too strongly, I would drive people
away. Deciding which side of me to present raised interesting questions
not just about female stereotypes, but feminist stereotypes. If I wanted
a partner was I daring enough to dismiss all men who may not relate to
feminist ideas presented in my profile? How important should I consider
these feminist values in relation to my future partner? I felt pressured
to be vague about some things such as my career plans and my love of
politics. Acting cute appeared the best way to get noticed. Here is what
I posted:

“I just moved to Phoenix this year. I am doing grad school here and I
really love it so far. I am pretty ambitious about career goals and
decided in the new year I should be more social. I have some old fashion
values about family, but overall I would say I am a pretty modern woman.
The most uncomfortable part of this whole profile stuff is picking your
body type- I think I have a "great body" but that wasn't an option.
Humor is really important for me, and I can't picture spending a lot of
time around someone unless they make me laugh and laugh at my jokes too.
I can be very sarcastic and argue at times, but I am very much a people
person and I enjoy socializing. If you are looking for a girl who will
follow, that isn't me- eek sorry. I am very interested in making
friends, and don't mind a more casual get together. I only date people
who really stand out to me.”

The problem of presenting a feminist self is not a unique problem:

An online persona has the potential for self-expression, at the time I
felt it was necessary to qualify my own behavior and minimize certain
characteristics. When retrospectively analyzing my own content I felt
some shock and embarrassment. In my attempt to follow the “norms”, I
found myself apologizing for my strengths. I wanted to present a strong
feminist identity but feared the stereotypes that would be unnecessarily
placed on me. Personality traits, which may be authentic, can be
off-putting if they do not conform to gender performanc.[^17_Lindsay_6] So I opted
to reduce my complicated essence to something simpler, an
advertisement…a potential date.

I had other opportunities to present my persona to potential dates. I
could check off interests from the site’s predetermined checklist. I had
numerous options, such as reading, hiking, working out, travel, “hot”
spots, and other options for first date topics. I quickly learned that
the topics were broad enough to match me with almost anyone. Certain
leisure activities and consumer behaviors nearly all members were
included.[^17_Lindsay_14] For example, I can assume nearly all men are interested in
weight lifting because that always came up as a common interest. This
simplification of people is dangerous because, “…that reduction of life
is what gets broadcasted between friends \[daters\] all the time. What
is communicated between people eventually becomes their truth.
Relationships take on the trouble of software engineering”. [^17_Lindsay_33]
Reducing ones self means that other daters viewing your profile are
relying on limited information, largely based on consumer behaviors, and
have no way of knowing how important a person’s interest is based on a
checkmark.[^17_Lindsay_14] The checklist is left open for interpretation, and if a
woman selects an activity, her identity is decided for her by that
checkmark.

For example, a user might “like” dancing. I chose this category because
I was a dance instructor and still enjoy attending classes occasionally.
However, this could easily be construed as dancing in nightclubs, which
I also enjoy, but does not accurately represent what I meant when I
selected “dancing.” Further, dancing and nightclubs and are typically
associated with “bad girl behavior.” Thus, reduction to a category
brings with it the performativity of other woman’s behaviors and
choices, now on the dating site, and throughout history. [^17_Lindsay_6] The
selection of “dancing” or any other behavior becomes redefined by the
male reader and conformed to his assumptions about women who enjoy
dancing. Interestingly, after my experience on Match.com I decided that
for Okcupid I would I only post a picture. I did not include a bio or
answer questions about my personality, but I received a similar level of
interest from potential suitors as I received on Match.com. Although I
had struggled with how to present my identity as a modern, feminist
woman to daters, apparently my most important attribute was my
appearance. All that mattered was the picture. Despite my personal hopes
of tweaking, and altering my profile in order to indicate the type of
person I am to other daters, I remained an advertisement in the space.

## Consumer Satisfaction

To conclude the story of my experience in online dating culture I will
describe interactions with the other users. After investigating the
online spaces of commercial dating sites, I would like to offer the
following examples as key incidents that influenced the interactions.[^17_Lindsay_9]
I believe that many of these incidents were part of a larger set of
socio-cultural norms found in all dating situations that allow daters to
treat one another as objects. My virtual presentation (advertisement)
led to interactions where I was treated as a product, more so than as a
person. Often my silence was mistaken for intentional mysteriousness and
an invitation for a follow-up. However, Match.com and Okcupid do not
offer a mechanism to signal disinterest. With face-to-face interactions,
men are more likely to take safe bets and wait for a perceived signal or
appropriate body language. At the very least, I can offer a signal of
disinterest by walking away or turning my back to continue a
conversation with friends. Online, the cues are filtered, and hopeful
emotions may prompt a user to be even more courageous.[^17_Lindsay_33] Men may have
genuine hopes based in a false reality. Yet, when a real person rejects
someone, the feelings are real. The intensity of the emotion may not be
experienced any differently at all, even thought the interaction took
place online. Some men have lashed out, and others tried to change my
mind through repeated offers, other men did not pursue beyond the first
message. All of these problematic dating rituals began offline, but
continue in this space. However, just as in the offline world, women are
supposed to be flattered and intrigued by all offers. [^17_Lindsay_6]

The first example is a fabricated account based on a real email exchange
between myself and a potential suitor: “You know, you look better as a
brunette.” At first I could not figure out why would a complete stranger
felt compelled to critique me without ever having spoken any other words
to me? My initial thought was, “Who does he think he is?!” I replied, “I
don’t ask or take advice from complete strangers.” Within minutes I got
another reply. “Wow. I was just trying to be helpful. No wonder you are
single— you cunt.” The majority of the I met online did not make such
bold moves. However, I couldn’t help but wonder if the rejection he felt
was enhanced because in an online space people are supposed to treat one
another as products. And especially, myself as a female dater should
have been grateful and receptive to his feedback as a consumer.

By emphasizing traffic, the site clouds users’ judgments about the
purpose of online dating. The site teaches users to value consumption by
measuring success as the number of views your profile receives, and in
the age of hook-up culture I wonder if people don’t see this endless
pool of daters as a means of shuffling different partners in and out
with efficiency. The second example I offer is a fabricated version of a
very common text conversation I had with many daters.

Suitor: “Hey, whats up?”

Me: “Hi, not much, how are you? This is Mike, right?”

Suitor: “Yeah, it’s Mike. I’m good.”

Me: “Sweet. So what are you up to?”

Suitor: “Nothing really, just watching TV relaxing a little bit.”

Me: “Nice.”

Suitor: “Wanna send me a pic?”

Me: “No thanks, I don’t really do that.”

Suitor: “You don’t have to take your clothes off! Lol.”

Me: “Oh I know, I just don’t really like send pics to people I have
never met. Lol. I know it might seem strange, but I just don’t do that.”

Suitor: “Oh common, why not? You must be trying to hide something.”

Me: “Lol, nope. I just feel weird sending an image or picture of myself
to a complete stranger. Its always been my policy. Don’t worry!”

Suitor: “So you really won’t send one at all?”

Me: “No, nothing personal.”

Suitor: “K. I’m not sure if I want to meet up then, unless you will send
the picture.”

As previously discussed there is great emphasis on attractiveness. The
more you are viewed, the better your chances, and the more gender
conforming the profile, the more views you will attract.[^17_Lindsay_6] My private
conversations with men lead me to believe that they were invested and
interested in making sure the attraction level translated into real
life. That is understandable, the question I was always left with, is
how the potential for deception left men feeling they had a right to
access my image on command. After giving very rational and what I
believed, justified reasons for not sharing cell phone pictures; I was
often dismissed. I believe this dismissal was based on two reasons, one
the idea that I was a replaceable product in a flooding market. The
second, reason was that as a woman setting clear and firm boundaries
around the ownership of my body was seen as unattractive and difficult,
no matter how politely I state it. [^17_Lindsay_6] Not all users behaved this way,
but the site potentially facilitates these experiences. [^17_Lindsay_34]

The last incident, or example I will use presents more questions than
answers. However, I think if we are to dismiss the experience of sexual
aggression from the online dating experience, it will not offer a
holistic picture. To be clear I have had these types of conversations in
bars, at schools, at night clubs, over text message, and through online
chat after I got to know someone. Yet in real life, when a man would
approach me in a public place, for the first time, the conversation
rarely evolved so quickly. This is not a condemnation of casual sex, or
an attempt to explain or hypothesize about when sex should be introduced
into relationships. It is important to note, that in my experience men
would often discuss quickly, even before actually meeting me, topics of
sexuality and physical intimacy. Here is an example of a fabricated
conversation with a man met online, but not in person.

Suitor: “Hi there beautiful. How have you been?”

Me: “Good, how are you doing?”

Suitor: “I’m great, just kinda lonely.”

Me: “Lol, oh yeah? You are lonely?”

Suitor: “Ok, well I’m actually horny. Ha. Wanna hang out?”

Research is still developing theories and hypotheses around intimacy the
perceived meaning, influences, and changes brought on through new
technologies.[^17_Lindsay_35] Walther believes that mediated spaces enhance the
opportunity for hyperpersonal communication. Research about college
students communication patterns shows that there is a progression or
pattern for mediated exchanges; participants described meeting people in
person and then finding one another through social media, followed by
private direct message conversations, and lastly giving out cell phone
numbers for text messages and phone calls. The spaces where privacy is
perceived, especially text messaging and direct messaging through chat,
could evoke feelings of intimacy that lead to conversation about sex
more quickly. The topic is certainly a part of contemporary dating
experiences, and sexual practices within relationships could be
influenced by online dating culture. “In online life, the pace of
relationships speeds up. One quickly moves from infatuation to
disillusionment and back. And the moment one grows even slightly bored,
there is easy access to someone new”[^17_Lindsay_35] People already use online space
to find casual sex, but in the near future I wonder how as users we will
keep casual sexual networks separate from dating relationship networks.
In my own experience the boundaries between these two spaces is already
becoming blurred, and perhaps all dating networks will blend together in
the future.

## Conclusion

Essentially online dating sites transform people into advertisements
whose worth is determined by the amount of traffic they can generate.
Many commercial dating sites follow a similar format setting a precedent
for online dating culture. In this regard, a dating profile is not much
different than a personal ad in the local newspaper, yet the pace of
online dating is much faster, more resourceful, and growing in
popularity. For the sake of keeping profiles in a pleasing and enticing
state, the sites promote traditional gender roles that inhibit users
from creating a more nuanced identity. To compete, women and men are
forced to market themselves like products. This ritual can dehumanize
and in turn encourage daters to objectify one another. However, I
believe these sites provide a valuable service to their users, so long
as the users realize the profiles on the sites are limited and the
information portrayed is restricted by the space. It takes time and
effort to develop a personal relationship with a potential partner, and
dating sites can only provide a forum; the real work is still up to the
individual.
