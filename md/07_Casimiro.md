# Self-presentation in the Portuguese Online Dating Scene: Does Gender Matter?

### CLÁUDIA CASIMIRO

## Introduction

Two decades ago, *Time* magazine, in an issue entitled 'The strange new
world of the Internet', pointed out why the Internet would never go
mainstream: "It was not designed for doing commerce, and it does not
gracefully accommodate new arrivals."[^7_Casimiro_1] The prediction could not have
been more wrong. As argued by numerous authors, the reality shows that
not only the Internet became very popular but it also represents a
tremendous change in society. It could be argued that the Internet has
brought about societal implications to the magnitude of the industrial
revolution or the printing press.[^7_Casimiro_2] Not only does the Internet pursue
organizational and commercial purposes, but its sociability and
communication features - "the *relational* Internet": practices in which
people engage to interact and share information and meaning[^7_Casimiro_3] - are
high and will likely increase.[^7_Casimiro_4]

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) through email, audio and video,
has become a commonplace tool in the industrialized countries, allowing
for the contact between more people, more often and through increasingly
diversified channels, giving rise to a new form of social organization:
the *network society*.[^7_Casimiro_5] "A network of relationships, weak ties or
intimate that occurs in [different] environments (...) the constant
interaction between online and offline spaces".[^7_Casimiro_6] Among these, online
dating sites claim a prominent role in the social and love life of
millions of individuals in many different countries.

Over the past few years, networking sites and particularly cyberdating,
"the process of getting to know someone online via the Internet before
transferring the relationship to offline or face-to-face
interaction",[^7_Casimiro_7] have been a growing area of research. Scholars from a
variety of academic disciplines such as communication studies,
psychology and sociology, making use of distinct approaches, models and
theories, have shown interest for the analysis of a myriad of issues
linked with: self-presentation strategies and mate preferences; online
communication and attraction; sincerity and deception; trust and
privacy; self-disclosure; identity; sexuality; infidelity; and gender
differences in online dating.[^7_Casimiro_8] Previous studies have mainly dealt
with the textual parts of online dating Profiles and only recently
researchers started to use images and photographs as a data source.[^7_Casimiro_9]

This paper opens with a general account of the role of the Internet as a
matchmaker, discussing primarily the strategies employed by users when
constructing their online dating Profiles. It then focuses on social
representations of gender, sex roles stereotypes, and in the differences
between male and female dating advertisements. The goal of the paper is
to explain the gender dynamics characterizing the process of online
dating self-presentation, particularly in the cultural context of
Portugal. The main research question which guided the study was: to what
extent do Portuguese men and women adhere to established traditional
gender roles in the composition of their online dating Profiles? To gain
new knowledge about the subject, sub-questions emerged: to what extent
do users self-disclose and what kind of information do they show in
their presentation messages? Which options do male and female daters
choose for self-characterization regarding physical appearance,
personality traits and socioeconomic status and social capital? What do
portraits and images uploaded reveal? The paper concludes with the idea
of the persistence versus change of gender stereotypes and lastly
presents considerations for a future research agenda.

## Cupid Lurking Online

Millions of people across the globe know, by personal experience,
something that the literature confirms: the Internet is a valid mean of
initiating intimate, romantic and personally fulfilling
relationships.[^7_Casimiro_10] In fact, online dating, more particularly in the
US but in the future, possibly, in the rest of the Western world as
well, is becoming one of the most common ways of meeting potential love
partners. The Internet has been gaining ground on more traditional forms
of meeting romantic partners such as friends, family, school or
neighborhood. Rosenfeld and Thomas, have found that "for heterosexual
couples who met in 2009, the Internet was the third most likely way of
meeting."[^7_Casimiro_11] Also in the US context, the study of Cacioppo et
al.[^7_Casimiro_12], using a representative sample of 19,131 respondents, married
between the years 2005 and 2012, concluded that more than one third of
North American marriages start now online.

Virtual spaces where individuals can meet include, but are not limited
to, online dating sites; internet classifieds; chat rooms; instant
messaging; online games; and social networking websites. Forms of
finding romantic or sexual partners, beyond the traditional ways,
namely, the use of matrimonial advertisements, date back to the end of
the 17^th^ century. "By the early eighteen century, matrimonial
advertising was booming, along with the expansion of print and the
proliferation of newspapers, pamphlets and periodicals."[^7_Casimiro_13] And around
the 19^th^ century there are records of the phenomenon of mail-order
brides and matchmaker services among certain religious groups in the
Northwest of the US[^7_Casimiro_14]

It may be said that love has no price. However, it can - and it was -
transformed and developed into a highly profitable business: dating
sites are a million dollar industry. The number of unmarried people has
been increasing for the last decades in the Western society, but the
social pressure for a conjugal life persists. Thus, although differently
from the way partners met through matrimonial ads posted in newspapers
and magazines in old times, the internet became from the outset a way
for people to browse hundreds of databases with millions of users,
filtering them by age, location, physical attractiveness, income, etc.
They did it in the search for "Mr. or Ms. Right".[^7_Casimiro_15] Then, in the
beginning of the 21st century, with the advent of more sophisticated
computer software, began the age of the algorithm, allowing partners to
find more compatible matches. The popularity of online dating sites
seems to represent an unexpected and truly magical instrument to open up
new venues in the world of date and romance. Nowadays, according to a
recent article from Forbes Magazine:

> The pool has deepened such that around half of all single people use
> online dating services at some point, and the algorithms that power
> them have gotten about as smart as they're going to get for the time
> being. What users want isn't more or better matches on the screen (…).
> What they want is an easier and faster way to meet them IRL - in real
> life. "The big thing now is offline"[^7_Casimiro_16]

## Possible Selves: Managing Online Presentations

Over the years, personal presentations on the Internet have been
changing significantly. In its early days, the Internet was seen as a
space where, thanks to anonymity, individuals were able to create and
recreate their identities, composing fictional characters and playing
roles of people different from their own self. Gender switching
practices were common in chat rooms, online games, forums and other
virtual spaces.

Currently, the Internet evolved in the creation of personalized
environments where users build realistic presentations of
themselves.[^7_Casimiro_17] The aim is to achieve inter-personal objectives: bond
with the family and real friends, establish new friendships, create
virtual communities of mutual interests, find sexual and romantic
partners or set (future) professional contacts. On the contrary of their
predecessors, nowadays, self-presentations tend to be carefully
constructed in order to allow personal agendas in the offline
environment. Thus, self-presentation on dating sites, according to
literature, follows rational choices about what to write on Profiles and
what images to show.[^7_Casimiro_18] Self-presentation strategies, and the way
individuals (re)create their online identities, are important in
relationship initiation and self-disclosure plays an important role. For
this reason, as it occurs in circumstances others than online
dating,[^7_Casimiro_19] daters feel the need to please and attract others. They
seek to create a good impression on others by stressing and bringing out
the attributes and personal characteristics deemed most valuable.

Occasionally, in order to attract others, daters lie about themselves.
Those lies, usually, are not perceived as factual lies. More than having
to do with intrinsic personal features, they have to do with external
ones (e.g. age, height – normally men lie more about this item then
women, weight – women tend to lie more about this characteristic,
smoking habits, or number of children). Hence, deviations tend "to be
ubiquitous but small in magnitude".[^7_Casimiro_20] As Ellison et al. argue "the
notion that people frequently, explicitly, and intentionally 'lie'
online is simplistic and inaccurate".[^7_Casimiro_21] Self-presentation and the
construction of an online Profile can be a complex process mixing
different domains: "Real-I", "Social-I" and "Ideal-I".[^7_Casimiro_22] That is not
necessarily bad, since "possible selves"[^7_Casimiro_23] may act as an important
element of one's self-knowledge.

> Giddens (1990) argues that one important aspect of identity in
> modernity is the ability to self-narrate… Those who actively
> engage in the 'reflexive project of the self' (…) that is, rewriting
> the personal narrative as identity construction, can presumably
> function well in the modern world, and as a corollary through online
> spheres that cater for these narrative constructions of self.[^7_Casimiro_24]

## Social Representations of Gender and Stereotypes

Social representations can be understood as a way of interpreting and
thinking about everyday reality, a form of social knowledge that, in
opposition to the scientific knowledge, is entitled as common sense.
Bearing in mind the central purpose of this paper and to the extent that
sexual belonging is related to specific ways in which one learns to be,
feel, think, act and see the world, gender is a conceptual category that
deserves to be explored. The same for gender stereotypes that are
socially constructed around it - that is, broadly accepted judgments
about men and women regarding personality traits, physical appearance,
behaviors, occupations, and so on.

To understand the processes involved in the construction of gender, it
is worth noting that being a man or a woman is to act accordingly to
what people in society evaluate as masculine and feminine. This has
little or nothing to do with the biological nature and physiology of
each body. Nonetheless, it is on that body, with a biologically defined
sex, that gender attributes are fixed. Attributes or traits are socially
constructed and internalized, and may vary greatly in time and from one
culture to the next. They are often perceived as part of the nature of
the individuals. Gender roles and stereotypes are not natural, yet they
are naturalized.

In recent decades, in most Western countries and Portugal is no
exception, profound changes occurred in the ways men and women construct
their gender identity and maintain interpersonal relationships. At this
level we found a gradual abandonment of the traditional gender roles,
considered complementary and asymmetric: women taking the expressive,
emotionally supportive role of maintaining a balanced family structure
and devoted to the household management, and men occupied with the work
outside the home, carrying the instrumental and practical role of family
subsistence, authority and leadership.[^7_Casimiro_25]

> We have been witnessing a growing sentimentalisation, privatisation,
> secularisation and individualisation of families that transformed
> people's family lives into more plural and diverse combinations,
> particularly when compared with much more homogeneous models from the
> past. Nowadays, in family context, there's a greater importance given
> to gender equality but also to the sentimental aspect of
> relationships, in so far it carries the sense of greater
> accomplishment and personal well-being.[^7_Casimiro_26]

Multiple Portuguese sociological studies, mainly in the field of family
research, show that these gradual changes stimulated and incremented new
normative guidance on forms of experiencing dating, romance, and
partnership, intimacy and family life. The Carnation Revolution, in
1974, liberalized the Portuguese nation, and changed it into a
democratic, fairer, and egalitarian society. This political and social
transformation led and contributed to changes, also, in moral values and
privacy practices supported, in their turn, by adjustments and
innovations in the law occurring in terms of rights then conquered.
Gender inequalities gradually fade; the perspective of an active woman,
equal to man in rights and duties was progressively implemented; male
domination loses legal legitimacy and the traditional and patriarchal
order that ruled family life and intimate relationships shifts.
Regarding the romantic, emotional and intimate biographies of Portuguese
recent generations it is possible to detect an evolution in the gender
based double standard, which suggests a gradual harmonization between
the experiences of women and men. They seem to adhere to more
egalitarian discourses showing a less distinctive pattern of female and
male standards.

However, as Kimmel[^7_Casimiro_27] argues, gender still remains an organizing
principle around which individuals build their identities and social
representations of gender role relationships. That is, partly, what
explains why the accelerated transition to the dominant model of the
dual earner, in which both spouses pursue careers, did not erase the
traces of inequality between men and women in most Western societies,
and especially in the Portuguese one. At the turn of the century,
Portugal, a nation still with a conservative dimension, was regarded as
one of the countries where gender stereotypes were more
accentuated.[^7_Casimiro_28] Traditionalist patterns of male dominance over women,
especially regarding the division of housework and child care, are still
felt in Portugal. Those patterns influence men's and women's behavior.
Women, in particular, activate "dispositions they have been inculcated
with" and continue to respond to the "traditionalist expectations for
the performance of roles in our society."[^7_Casimiro_29]

It is, thus, noticeable the maintenance of gender representations that
lead to the (re)production of stereotypes and gender roles. Gender
stereotypes transmitted by the family, at the school and in the media,
continue to follow traditional clichés. Men are perceived as strong,
courageous, assertive, domineering, aggressive and depicted as
uninhibited, rational, independent, resistant, ambitious, confident and
geared for action; while female occur more frequently in the
conciliatory role – the peacemaker that does not foster conflict – and
they are also portrayed as good-looking; soft, delicate, calm,
dependent, caring, loving, emotional, affable and sensitive.[^7_Casimiro_30]

Notwithstanding the transformations in Portuguese society that have
occurred, there are two main social indicators that point to a stability
in, at least, two dimensions of the feminine stereotype, namely: the
sexualization and the role played in the family. In the first case it is
notorious that images of sexualized women are still common in
advertising and marketing material[^7_Casimiro_31], in the second case, numerous
studies show the persistence of a very traditional division of labor in
the Portuguese families, compared with other countries.[^7_Casimiro_32]

As Bourdieu suggests, the fact that male domination is no longer imposed
in all contexts is far from meaning, with obvious evidence, its
eradication. For the author, the principles of the dominant view - those
of male domination - remain active even if they are embedded "in the
form of schemes of perception and appreciation hardly accessible to
consciousness."[^7_Casimiro_33] Still, along with the reproduction of gender
stereotypes the issue of the equalization of gender also emerges.
Tradition and modernity coexist. To state it in a simplified way, in
this matter of gender, change does not occur as it is expected, change,
as Bourdieu explains, occurs in the permanence.

## Gender Differences in Dating Advertisements

Online or offline, it is important to remember that all subjects
construct their identity and try to convey a certain image of
themselves. Literature concerning personal advertisements, primarily in
newspapers and magazines, and more recently also on the Internet, namely
in dating sites, indicates that gender stereotypes influence the way men
and women describe the ideal partner and also the way they define
themselves in order to attract potential partners. Gender does influence
self-presentation characteristics: men's personal Profiles are more
likely to offer instrumental traits (education, career, financial
status, socioeconomic position), and to request expressive qualities in
women; whereas women offer physical attractiveness, personality
characteristics, and expressive features more often while seeking status
in the form of occupation and requesting for instrumental traits in
males.[^7_Casimiro_34]

Though a vast majority of the literature indicates that men and women
ads complement each other, there are studies challenging this assumption
with some puzzling results. Men may also be looking for financially
independent, successful and ambitious women[^7_Casimiro_35]; and women, on their
hand, relative to the opposite sex, are starting to emphasize
commitment, communication and the ability to express feelings. Also they
appear to be looking in male Profiles for "characteristics like warmth
and kindness, and attractiveness".[^7_Casimiro_36] In sum, research may be pointing
to a "gender-specific decline in mate value".[^7_Casimiro_37]

The construction of online dating Profiles tries to fit with what is
considered socially acceptable in the dominant culture. Therefore, it is
plausible to assume that Portuguese online self-presentations may
generate significant and important materials that contribute to address
concerns with the theoretical interpretation of continuity and social
and cultural change (innovation and tradition) in what gender roles are
concerned in the Portuguese context.

## Self-Presentation on the Internet: the Portuguese Case

In Portugal, printed dating ads have been studied, namely from a major
daily Portuguese newspaper,[^7_Casimiro_38] but online dating is severely lacking
academic research. In 2002, Cardoso showed that, in the context of
Portuguese Internet mediated communication (IMC) users, it was possible
to see "the formation of stable environments of intimate ties,
prolonging themselves outside the environment of IMC towards the offline
spaces".[^7_Casimiro_39] These intimate ties, concerned, among others, friendship
(30,2%) and friendship and love (2,3%), and in a recent report that
explores the relation of Portuguese people with the internet, the same
author mentions that 78,7% of internet users adhere to social networking
in order to meet new people.[^7_Casimiro_40] Who are these users, what motivates
them to meet new people, who do they meet and what kind of relationships
are established, that is still unknown.

Digital literacy in Portugal grew exponentially from the late 1990's to
the end of the last decade and the Internet gradually emerged as a
"community of chronic communicators."[^7_Casimiro_41] By the end of the 1990's the
use of the Internet as a 'social technology' for communication among
individuals was still the object of some apprehension[^7_Casimiro_42] but in 2009,
Portugal was already the European country with the third highest number
of users accessing social networking sites – after the UK and
Spain.[^7_Casimiro_43]

Scattered studies, in Portugal, have looked at the construction of
identities through CMC;[^7_Casimiro_44] at the dichotomy of online/offline
environments contributing to the debate on the connections between these
two worlds;[^7_Casimiro_45] at the subject of cybersex;[^7_Casimiro_46] and at the
presentation of self in Facebook.[^7_Casimiro_47] However, apart from this very few
studies, the review of the literature reveals no research so far on the
potential of the Internet, particularly of dating sites, to foster
romantic relationships.

## Falling in Line with Traditional Gender Representations?

Prior international studies have documented that dating sites are
important venues to find romantic partners, and that female and male
users pursue distinct self-presentation strategies to attract others
online. In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the
number of Internet users in Portugal but, as previously mentioned, there
is a gap in the scientific literature on how the Portuguese use
cyberspace, and specifically dating sites, to initiate romantic
relationships.

In this research, the main goal was to understand if Portuguese men and
women adhere to established traditional gender roles in the composition
of their online dating Profiles. To gain new insight on the subject,
sub-questions emerged: what does the content of the presentation
messages reveal? Which options do male and female daters choose for
self-characterization regarding physical appearance, personality traits
and socioeconomic status and social capital? What do portraits and
images uploaded reveal?

The final sample for this study included 200 Profiles - 100 men and 100
women - and 1006 photographs - 485 of men and 521 of women -, all
gathered from one particular Internet dating site (Meetic.pt), during
2011. Meetic was chosen for three reasons: firstly, it is the top dating
site in Europe; secondly, it was the first dating site to appear in
Portugal (in 2005); and, thirdly, it is relatively widespread, recording
the most registered users.

The user's Profiles were selected according to 5 criteria: firstly,
there was a photograph and a self-presentation ad; secondly, they were
between 25 and 60 years old; thirdly, they lived in Portugal; fourth,
they lived in Lisbon; and finally, they lived within a 30km radius of
Lisbon.[^7_Casimiro_48] For the rest (e.g. education, income, profession physical
appearance, marital status, etc.) the random effect was maintained. The
sample was limited to heterosexuals (women seeking men and men seeking
women). The 200 Profiles were proportionally selected among these age
groups with most registered users in the site, according to the above-
mentioned criteria (men: 17 aged 25 – 30 years; 39 aged 31 - 40 years; 30
aged 41 - 50 years; 14 aged 51 - 60 / women: 13 aged 25 – 30 years; 30 aged
31 - 40 years; 36 aged 41 - 50 years; 21 aged 51 - 60).

The Profiles in the dating site Meetic.pt include several items: a space
to upload images; a space where users are encouraged to write a
self-presentation message; a closed-ended questionnaire about personal
data, traits and tastes; habits, religion, income, eye-color; type of
preferred food; partner-preferences, and a set of other characteristics
(to be answered with a drop-down menu); and also a questionnaire with
pre-defined yes/no questions to be selected by the users, who can choose
to post it in their Profiles so that visitors may respond.

The first step in this study was to select and save the Profiles to
individual files in the computer and then analyze all the items with the
exception of the fourth - the questionnaire with pre-defined yes/no
questions. Regarding the third item, only some specific elements of the
self-questionnaire with pre-defined questions were studied: physical
attributes ("aspect", "silhouette" and "the most attractive in me");
socioeconomic traits ("qualifications", "profession" and "income"); and
personality/psychological characteristics.

Self-presentation messages and the selected items of the
self-questionnaire with pre-defined questions were analyzed using a
thematic and summative content analysis methodology[^7_Casimiro_49] and employing
techniques of the grounded theory that Larossa defines as a "valuable
set of procedures for thinking about theoretically textual
materials".[^7_Casimiro_50] A semi-inductive approach, qualitative and
interpretative, was followed in the search for unexpected data that
would contribute substantially to the construction of hypotheses in a
dialectical relationship between theoretical reflection and
reality.[^7_Casimiro_51] From an analysis of the 200 presentation messages of both
males and females, "thematic files" or "category files"[^7_Casimiro_52] were
created for both sexes. In each of these files, excerpts of the user's
most significant descriptions were labeled and the words most often used
counted. The content analysis of the messages was guided by the main
research question and required an observation grid containing some
possible male and female stereotypes. The grid was built based on a set
of studies mainly centered in the Portuguese culture that in recent
years have been discussing the topic of stereotypes and presenting lists
of traits and attributes commonly considered typically masculine or
feminine.

For the study of Profile photographs Bell's methodology - content
analysis of visual images - was followed: "an empirical (observational)
and objective procedure for quantifying recorded 'audio-visual' (…)
representation using reliable, explicitly defined categories".[^7_Casimiro_53]
Bearing in mind the research questions, the first goal was to discover
the categories, common themes and subthemes emerging across the male and
female Profile photos, and also to note the different or unique pictures
appearing in the Profiles. In the content analysis of visual images "the
researcher is usually interested in whether, say, women are depicted
more or less frequently than men in relation to some variable or
quality".[^7_Casimiro_54] Thus, each Profile was coded for the number of photos
uploaded, number of photos with face shots, and number of photos showing
things other than the user (for instance, animals, places, cities, and
objects) and the circumstances in which they appear. The number of
photos where users exhibited parts of their body (what parts, in which
positions), and the clothing they were wearing (clothing, for example,
was coded on the dimensions of color and kind of clothing – sportswear,
formal wear, casual wear, etc.) were also taken into account. A close
reading of the images, in-depth scrutiny and "treating the visual as
problematic"[^7_Casimiro_55] was the next step.

## Are Men from Mars and Women from Venus?

The idea that men and women belong to "distinct planets" and that the
differences between them are a consequence of inner psychological
differences between the genders has long been widespread. There is a
belief that each gender can be understood in terms of distinct ways of
being, feeling, and thinking, as if there were gender specific
worldviews. In fact, there are gender differences, but what sociological
research, and this study in particular, show is that gender specific
frameworks are largely, if not entirely, social constructions reproduced
over time.

> Discourses on gender do not merely reflect a pre-existing
> differentiation, they actively contribute to the construction of this
> differentiation and, thus, they "do gender".[^7_Casimiro_56]

In this context, what does the analysis of the Profile ads reveal? Focus
will be placed firstly on the presentation messages and the
self-characterization online daters create. Secondly, the analysis will
focus on the photographs uploaded by the female and male users. Taking
into consideration the amount of data gathered and analyzed, only the
aspects considered most relevant to answer the research questions will
be highlighted.

Data obtained in previous studies indicates that online daters follow
rational choices when presenting themselves to potential romantic
partners.[^7_Casimiro_57] Although more research should be carried to broadly and
firmly sustain this claim, in this study it was possible to confirm that
this seems true, also, for Portuguese online daters. Men and women try
to present themselves as acceptable people to others. Both want to
please and attract, and they underline and show up the attributes or
characteristics considered most valuable for themselves and/or possibly
for others. From the analysis of the presentation messages and the items
previously mentioned, five aspects of the users Profiles stand out:
physical attributes; socioeconomic capital; life styles and preferred
activities; psychological, relational and behavioral traits; and,
finally, age preferences of the potencial partner.

## Physical Attributes

Comparing to men, women fill out more the physical traits of the
closed-ended questionnaire that characterizes users. By physical traits,
it is meant: "aspect", "silhouette" and what is considered "the most
attractive in me". But the difference is not astonishing: 69% of the 100
men fill out these items against a little bit more of women: 74%. What
is more notable is that 47% of women, when filling the item "aspect", by
choosing options like "not bad", "attractive", "very attractive" and "an
authentic model" stress much more than men (only 26% choosing these
elements), their presumable beautiful and charming look. The least
filled in of all items of the questionnaire, included in this major item
of the "Physical attributes", is "the most attractive in me" - perhaps
because it is the third on the list of all the items to be filled in by
the users when completing their online profile. It is curious, though,
that regarding the "silhouette" item, the second one, there are 18% of
women choosing the option "with graceful curves" and only two percent of
men choosing this option.

Women have managed to free themselves from the stereotype of woman and
wife. However, despite all the battle, what these results may indicate
is that Portuguese women still have internalized the stereotypes from 50
years ago, but now also carrying the "heightened sexuality, one of the
burdens of the post sexual revolution society that freed the chains that
bound the women's desires, but brought to the spotlight the female body
in advertising and on the media in general"[^7_Casimiro_58], thus contributing for
the reproduction of the female stereotype as a sex symbol.

## Socioeconomic Capital

The most salient result that emerges when analyzing the data relating
the socioeconomic capital of the individuals that compose the sample of
this research is that neither men nor women seem to feel very
comfortable with the filling of these aspects. The percentage of users
that do not fill in the items of "qualifications", "profession" and
"income" are high, particularly when compared to other elements of the
closed-ended questionnaire. Nonetheless, there are a few more men (67%)
than women (51%) doing it. Furthermore, it can be stressed that,
although the numbers are not high, still, 19% of men disclose
information about their "income" whereas only six percent of women fill
in this element.

Although the recent literature on the European family lives, notably,
the gender order within the family context, suggests that the old
breadwinner model, at least concerning attitudes, is outdated[^7_Casimiro_59], such
detail may suggest a certain persistence of the notion of this man
breadwinner model in the Portuguese society. If not in attitudes, at
least, as an ideal model, particularly if we take into account that the
distribution of male users that indicate this bit of information goes
from men with 26 years old to men with 56 years old.

## Life Styles and Preferred Activities

This is perhaps the aspect, of all those who are referred by users, in
which gender does not seem to influence the responses. It is relatively
accepted and widespread that both women and men appreciate traveling;
going for a walk; going to the cinema; listening to music; going to
concerts; enjoying the beach; watching the sea; appreciating the sunset,
the moon, the stars, the countryside, or the nature; being with the
family; reading; writing; laughing; having a drink; cooking; being with
friends; practicing sports; dancing; shopping and breaking out of
routines. Yet, the analysis of the relational and behavioral traits
reveals that gender stereotypes have not been vanished. On the contrary,
they are part of the scenario of how male and female online daters
present themselves to others on the context of finding romantic partners
in the Internet. We shall see it in the next point to be discussed.

## Psychological, Relational and Behavioral Traits

The personality traits of male and female users, gathered from their
written self-presentation messages and from the
personality/psychological characteristics selected by them in the
closed-ended questionnaire, were analyzed accordingly to the grid of
male and female stereotypes previously mentioned. The main results
demonstrate that women gender role stereotypes are the ones extensively
more (re)produced by female online daters (see Figure 1.).

![Figure 1](imgs/c-casimiro-images/C_Casimiro_image1_Female_Stereotypes.tif)

Figure 1. Female stereotypes

As Figure 1 show, it is quite significant the number of women choosing
words such as: affable, instinctive, caring, sensitive, dreamy,
conciliatory, and generous for their self-presentations. Also, it can be
underlined that some words are exclusively used by women: feminine,
maternal, selfless and soft. As for the male stereotypes they do not
appear so markedly, but still, it is interesting to note that in
contrast to women, there are more men emphasizing traits such as:
adventurous, active, hard-worker, independent, self-confident and, above
all, courteous (see Figure 2).

![Figure 2](imgs/c-casimiro-images/C_Casimiro_image2_Male_Stereotypes.tif)

Figure 2. Male stereotypes

> The traditional courtesies that have served to differentiate gentlemen
> from ladies, such as men opening doors for women (…), may also serve
> to communicate and perpetuate the expectation that men are stronger
> than, dominant over, and more powerful than women (…). Thus, an act of
> common courtesy may be viewed by some as a political statement
> designed to perpetuate traditional views of masculinity and femininity
> (…) and may sometimes serve as 'a way of preserving the inequities
> between the sexes' (…).[^7_Casimiro_60]

Also, it is possible to detect words solely employed by men, such as:
perseverant, prudent, responsible, ambitious, rational and mature.

Four basic aspects can, thusly, be highlighted. Firstly, Portuguese
online daters tend to choose personal attributes and psychological
characteristics that fit the still prevailing and traditionally feminine
and masculine stereotypes in the Portuguese cultural context. Women give
much more weight to emotional, affective, and romantic attributes,
whereas, on their turn, men bring out characteristics related to work,
self-determination, rationality, and the practical side of life.

Secondly, despite a relatively marked division among men and women
options for, correspondingly, masculine and feminine stereotypes, there
are also some men stressing their sensitive, caring, instinctive, and
especially, their affable side, and a few women mentioning their active,
independent and self-confident facets.

Thirdly, there is a rather broad set of users that although reproducing
gender stereotypes, simultaneously use gender-neutral attributes in
their self-presentations like: honest, genuine, simple, cheerful and
optimistic.

Finally, and to avoid too simplistic and linear explanations about the
(re)production of gender role stereotypes, by Portuguese men and women,
it must be taken into consideration the context where these stereotypes
are being (re)produced: the online dating scene. Men and women are
describing themselves accordingly to what they imagine to be the
attributes and features others might be looking in a potential romantic
partner. In the scenario of dating sites, when individuals use certain
traits and categories they might be trying to meet what they consider to
be the most desired, respected or advantageous position in that given
context. Self-presentations can, thus, be interpreted as male and female
performances of certain masculinities and femininities.

For example, in the context of financial business or management and
administration, namely in Portugal, it is known that women employ
specific strategies that enable them to be accepted as leaders and
integrate teams.[^7_Casimiro_61] It is highly probable that if they had to fill out
a profile for an application to integrate a big company they would
rather opt to use self-descriptive words like "active", "perseverant",
"independent", "responsible" and "mature". Similarly, in the particular
situation of online dating, recent American literature has shown that in
the beginning of the 21^st^ century, contrary to prior researches, there
are women already describing themselves as financially independent,
successful and ambitious. Curiously, these female online advertisements
produce higher response rates comparing to those where women describe
themselves as lovely, very attractive and slim.[^7_Casimiro_62]

## Age Preferences of the Potential Partner

Love without social constraint is a myth. The Sociology of the family,
have shown, for decades, that couples tend to be homogamous, "that is,
individuals are attracted to persons who are similar on one or more
characteristics".[^7_Casimiro_63] Homogamy is a social proximity that may be based
on culture, class, religion, economic status or age: the so-called age
homogamy. On the Internet the possibilities of meeting someone that
otherwise would never be met are high. This means that the chances of
getting to know someone from a geographically distinct zone, with
different socioeconomic and cultural capitals, religion or age are
immense. This is why some literature suggests that on the Internet
partners are chosen with greatest differences in age or level of
education though, apparently, with more similar interests and
values.[^7_Casimiro_64]

In this research, results point in the direction that the age
preferences of the potential partner go along the tendency that occurs
between Portuguese couples who met, and got married, in the offline
world. The criteria used for marital choice concerning the age of the
partner in the offline world is also visible in the choices male and
female online daters make when they indicate, in their profiles, the
preferred age of the partner they are looking for. Hence, what this
study reveals is that there is an age hypergamy (see Figures 3. and 4.).
In Portugal, six in ten marital unions imply an age difference favoring
men and, in most cases, the man is two to five years older than the
woman.[^7_Casimiro_65]

![Figure 3](imgs/c-casimiro-images/C_Casimiro_image3_Age_of_the_partner_MEN.tiff)

Figure 3. Distribution of the preferred age of the partner - Men

![Figure 4](imgs/c-casimiro-images/C_Casimiro_image4_Age_of_the_partner_WOMEN.tif)

Figure 4. Distribution of the preferred age of the partner - Women

Over the decades, in Western countries, including Portugal, the age
difference between marriage partners has been decreasing. Among older
age groups, however, and depending of the marital status of individuals,
hypergamy persists and works differently depending on the gender (men
marry much younger women, and women marry not only much older man but
also much younger men). In this sense, it is important to note that yes,
gender does matter - not only in the strategies followed by men and
women in their self-presentations, but also in the choices they make
about the preferred age of the partner.

The results of this research indicate that age preferences, likewise in
the offline environment, shift with age (and presumably – like in the
Portuguese context happens - with the marital status). But these
preferences are not random: gender does in fact matter. As they age, men
prefer younger women, whereas women's partners' preferred age becomes
more diverse.

## And What about the Portraits?

The literature on online dating reveals that posting pictures increases
several times more the chances of matching. Meetic.pt encourages users
to do so. Of those who comply, many explicitly mention the importance of
a photograph in the Profile:

> "*Profiles with no photographs are like books without a cover*"
>
> [woman, single, 39 years]
>
> "*Profiles without photos, no thanks: if you go fishing you've got to
> get wet*"
>
> [man, separated, 41 years]
>
> "*Please, those of you that don't show their image do not contact me.
> Although 'what is essential is invisible to the eye' I'm not
> interested in those who haven't got the courage to show up! I will
> respect them but I will not answer. Thank you.*"
>
> [woman, divorced, 39 years]

Although the sample in this study was composed of Profiles with ads and
pictures (100 men from the 2,686 found in the dating site, and 100
women, gathered from the 959 that had an advertisement and photographs),
it should be mentioned that according to the criteria previously
mentioned there are much more users just with self-presentation messages
and without photos than users with both (8,793 men and 3,736 women
without photo). Among those who upload photographs, there are only 6% of
women doing it, comparing with 17% of men. However, in the sample used
(N=200), the number of photographs uploaded by women (521) surpassed the
number uploaded by men (485). Moreover, more women than men uploaded
between just 1 and 5 photos (19 men uploaded just one photo, whereas 34
women did so). On the other hand, there are a few more women than men
uploading more than 15 photos (the maximum number uploaded by a man was
23, whereas, by a woman, it was 25 – the maximum allowed). This suggests
that, although there are more female Profiles without photos, when women
decide to post them, they seem to upload more than men.

Three categories emerged from the content analysis of the uploaded users
photographs. They focus on different aspects: the physical - photos
relating to the body (body fit, body look, body presentation); the
symbolic - images that suggest or represent ideas, qualities, tastes,
emotions and states of mind or spirit; and the material - photos showing
or pointing to physical objects, money or possessions (the material
world). In these distinct categories, it is possible to find
similarities and differences in the photos uploaded by the two genders.

Regarding similarities, almost one third of the total sample of
photographs is composed of face shots, a number equally distributed over
both genders. Regarding the physical category, men and women portray
themselves in various poses and behaviors, showing physically fit bodies
or parts of them - strong arms, pectoral muscles, flat bellies - on the
beach, in the pool or at home, and in glamour photographs taken at
marriages, baptisms or other special/party events. These photos show
them from flattering angles wearing fancy, sometimes expensive clothes,
accessories, and make up. Both the men and the women post symbolic
photographs, or photos of non-personal identity nature trying to
represent something or express intentions or feeling: sunsets, beautiful
landscapes, restaurants, pets, or fine art photography.

The most notable gender effect found in the photographs in the physical
category relates to the fact that women not only appear in 96.5% of the
photographs, contrasting with the 85% of photographs where men portray
themselves, but also reveal far more physical details than men do. Women
show particular parts of their body: lips, legs, tongue and navel
piercings, feet, and tattoos – on the shoulder, wrist, and nape of the
neck, chest, lower back, hip, and ankles. It is interesting to consider
this result in the light of the studies being made about how the media
produces gender stereotypes that, on their turn, are then internalized
by social actors and, again, thus, continuously reproduced. Tuna and
Freitas, in a research that undertook the analysis of perfume magazine
ads concluded that:

> There seems to be an emphasis on themes such as sports and
> business/professions in men's perfume ads, whereas women's fragrances
> tend to be advertised through motifs such as love, eroticism, glamour
> and fashion. (…) The depiction of women models is still more frequent,
> and that nudity and the erotic depiction of women participants
> prevail, when compared to similar proportion of men depicted in more
> business-like poses.[^7_Casimiro_66]

In relation to the symbolic category of photos, it is very interesting
to observe that there is not even one photograph posted by a woman
representing her workplace or some scenario that could indicate her
professional occupation. By contrast, eleven photos of men, though a
residual number in the 485 uploaded by them, were nonetheless classified
as "workplace" in the thematic files created when analyzing photographs.
Those pictures show men working as architects at a drawing table, as
civil engineers inspecting works, with a helmet on, as aircraft pilots,
policemen or firemen, in uniform, or at the office, sitting at the
computer, amid papers and files. This result is consistent with what
Neto and Pinto found when analyzing gender stereotypes in Portuguese
television advertisements a few years ago: "significant differences,
with proportionally more females (35%) being portrayed in the home than
males (12.7%) and more males being portrayed in occupational settings
(37.7%) than females (22.0%)."[^7_Casimiro_67]

Still, one of the more significant and explicit gender difference, if
not the most, was found in the material category. In this case, men
upload far more photographs (23) than women (5). They post photos of
their cars (e.g. convertibles), motorbikes, and boats, and images
showing indoor spaces (e.g., presumably, their houses or parts of them –
the pool, the fireplace, the library, old furniture, china). Images of
capital cities visited, paradisiacal beaches, desert landscapes, and ski
resorts – an indirect way of showing a certain economic or financial
status – are also much more commonly uploaded by men (28) than women
(9). These results show that the users are pursuing strategies in their
self-presentations online not only when they write their
self-presentation messages, but also when they select the photographs
that are going to portray them and potentially attract dating partners.

## Conclusion

Daters do not present themselves randomly or carelessly. On the
contrary, there is a notable attempt to please potential partners. These
findings extend those of other researches confirming that by a
"selective self-presentation"[^7_Casimiro_68], Portuguese men and women registered
in the dating site Meetic.pt try to manage impressions and promote the
relationships desired.

Women and men pursue distinct self-presentation strategies to attract
others online. There are important gender differences in the
self-presentation procedure and gender role stereotypes tend to be
(re)produced. Men seem more inclined to underline their rational and
practical attributes as well as their socioeconomic status, whereas
women activating ancient dispositions that have been inculcated with,
value their emotional, and affective facets, and their inclination to
dream. Women also emphasize their physical attributes more than men. The
findings of the current study are consistent with others who found that
"when selling the self, men market their financial and occupational
resources, whereas women offer physical attractiveness and appealing
body shape".[^7_Casimiro_69]

On one hand, it is possible to detect certain clues pointing toward
modern gender roles. Men describe their emotional and relationship
skills, their generosity and sensitivity, which reveals their
"orientation towards a sense of belonging and intimacy"[^7_Casimiro_70]. Some women
refer to their active and independent facets allied to some traits of
self-confidence mentioning, for instances, the importance of the hard
work. On the other hand, men and women tend to offer complementary
gender-based characteristics. Gender stereotypes perdure when male
daters reinforce the instrumental role and female daters accentuate the
expressive role. It seems, thus, that "rather than *being* modern, the
Portuguese like the *idea* of being modern."[^7_Casimiro_71]

It also possible to conclude that the positive attributes men and women
project fall into social norms around what is considered feminine and
masculine and are consistent with the contemporary gender roles in the
Portuguese society. Online self-presentations reflect shared cultural
values about gender and they contribute to the predominance of online
stereotypical gender identities. The association of women to the world
of reproduction and of men to the world of production has not been
completely fractured, and important traits of conventional gender
relations still persist today.[^7_Casimiro_72] Or, at least, "traditionalist
expectations for the performance of roles in our society"[^7_Casimiro_73] seem to
be still present.

It is clear that gender stereotypes persist along with social changes in
the relationships among men and women and the way they conceive
masculinity and femininity. Stereotypes may be internalized in
individuals, however, that does not mean that men are from Mars and
women from Venus. Sociological research reveals that differences between
countries with regard to values ​​and issues of family, work and gender
roles are higher than the differences characterizing males and females
from those countries. There also studies about online self-presentations
that show that differences may be higher between countries than between
genders.[^7_Casimiro_74] Kisilevich and Last,[^7_Casimiro_75] for instance, demonstrated that
cultural and national differences impact the characteristics of user
Profiles even for people of the same gender across countries.

Finally, one more point needs to be made. The conclusions of this
research seem to be valid though they must be viewed not as definitive
answers but as research proposals that deserve further investigation.

Online spaces where people can create their self-presentations,
producing, or not, different profiles, differ. Therefore, as some
authors have stressed, people may act differently when paying a fee for
an inscription on a dating site or for, example, to be included in a
discussion forum about ecological and environmental problems affecting
their community. Taking into consideration the exponential and quick
expansion of dating sites, there can also be significant differences
between them: specific sites for speed dating, for people who just want
to find a sexual partner (one night stand), for individuals who look for
their future husband or wife, people looking for homosexual
relationships, and so on. Therefore, when studying online dating
self-presentation, researches should take into account the specificity
of the site being studied since that apparently simple fact may have
important implications on the results obtained. It would be interesting
to study the self-descriptions impact on dating success. Also, a better
understanding of how these self-presentations reflect social and
cultural continuities and changes in gender roles over the recent past
is needed. Additionally, more qualitative research should be carried out
to give a voice to online daters, with the aim of gathering empirical
knowledge about online dating practices and the process of finding love
online. The influence of demographic variables such as age, educational
level, socio-economic status, and marital status, on the construction of
online dating Profiles, should also be studied in depth. Finally, more
attention must be given to photographs and to the role of visual
impression management, since it is known that Profile owners do not
self-expose themselves arbitrarily. Research on images and photographs,
namely self-portraits, is equally important since as Walker explains:

> The computer screen represents the connection between the self and
> society (…). At the same time as we connect with society, we do the
> reflective work we used to do only in mirrors, in private. (…) Perhaps
> our fascination with self-portraits in mirrors is an expression of our
> collective coming into being as digital subjects. We are subjects. I
> am a self. This is the first step in learning how to express ourselves
> with digital technology, and the first step in choosing to express
> *ourselves* rather than simply allowing ourselves to be described by
> others.[^7_Casimiro_76]
