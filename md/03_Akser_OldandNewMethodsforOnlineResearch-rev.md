# Old and New Methods for Online Research: The Case of Online Dating

### Murat Akser

The proverbial opening of the 2004 film *Closer* shows us a passionate
online chat message exchange between two people. Believing to be
courting a young woman Dan Woolf (Jude Law) makes advances with sexual
innuendos towards a woman or so he believes. The message exchange is
indeed a fake one, in fact, between two heterosexual men, one pretending
to be a woman Larry Gray (Clive Owen). This very virtual, gendered and
insecure nature of online intimacy makes it a complex phenomenon to
analyze. The psychological need for intimacy intertwines with the
corporate networked ad machine, which sells gendered images of men and
women to each other. Digital Technologies and mediated personal lives
overlap with the gendered nature of these digital landscapes.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_1]

Today intimacy and networked individualism go hand in hand through
online dating sites and social networks such as Facebook. These new
spaces function as courting places for millions. Yet these spaces are
also flowing sites of information that present new practices and modes
of existence for couples. Today online dating is a 100 million US\$
industry operating worldwide, answering both general and niche demand
for singles. Match.com’s own statistics estimate that about 10 percent
of all paying users find a partner within a year.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_2] Deborah Chambers
states ‘the fluidity and choice apparently offered by online dating fits
in neatly with today’s ethos of elective intimacy’.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_3]

What is done through online dating is a reflexive and self-engaged
impression management. Singles using online dating services are
project-managing the outcomes of their mediated romantic encounters.
Dysfunctional behavior such as stalking is also encountered in this
space. Teenagers and young people are now: ‘reconfiguring their notions
of privacy and publicity and their concepts of personal and
intimate’.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_4] Chambers is surprised how conventional intimacy remains
the same in new media. She states how the alienating pressures of work
life are countered by online dating that allows people to relive romance
in the most traditional way.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_5]

## A Humanities or a Social Science Issue?

The gathering and use of data related to online courtship seem to be
within the domain of psychology since the inception of the World Wide
Web, as the first articles and books go back to 1997. From the early
articles on, the emphasis has always been to find out who uses these
services and on deceptive self-presentation. The users of online dating
services were assumed to be shy people who could not experience face to
face interaction, but instead resorted to a behind the computer
approach.

The second assumption of the early researchers was that the users who
misrepresented themselves through their profile photos and
age-weight-height information wanted to have their romance chances
higher, so they lied to get an advantage. This deception can take
various forms: physical (both as data and information), discursive
(false representation of self during online interaction). The personal
impact of false representation on an individual can be devastating. The
interest of psychologist in the area is understandable in terms of
prevention of mental health problems such as depression and breakdown
that could lead to suicide. Yet positive impact of online dating in
terms of having a dialogue, however virtual, has been appreciated by
such researchers. The online dating of widows after the death of their
loved ones proves to be a cure for life long misery on the bereaving
parties.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_6]

## Who Dates Online?

The early studies focused on who uses online dating sites. Question of
what happened after the online couples met dominated the late 1990s.
Qualitative research by Andrea Baker between 1997-99 is a case in point.
Baker interviewed 43 couples to find out if they got along after they
met online. Baker analyzed email exchange between couples and did a
follow up interview with a small subsection of the people. The finding
can reflect the current status of online courtship after the arrival of
social networks today. The common similarities of online couples (circa
1997) were age (late thirties), marital status (were married), education
(at least a bachelor’s degree), offline meeting (4–7 months later),
distance (lived thousands of miles away), prior online relationships
(females none, males had experience). Online nicknames, modes and
content of communication, timing, and presentation of the photo have had
an impact on the research.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_7]

Studies done a decade later to find who goes online for courting have
revealed more results. The methods used changed from email analysis to
online surveys. A study done on Dutch Internet users aged between 18-60
through online questionnaire reveals that online dating was unrelated to
income and educational level. The high activity age of the users
shifted. Respondents between 30 and 50 years old were the most active
online daters. People low in dating anxiety were found to be more active
online daters than people high in dating anxiety.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_8] The measures for
the study were age, education, income, dating anxiety and frequency of
visit of dating sites. The study wanted to debunk the myth that only the
shy use online dating; in fact the less shy had more frequency in
attending these sites. The average age of the users was twenty-nine as
opposed to the Baker study’s 35 and over.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_9]

By 2010, the social demographic of Internet dating had changed. Sautter,
Tippett and Morgan used a larger sample with quantitative methods.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze 3,215 respondents a
nationally representative U.S. survey of Internet dating. The results
yielded that sociodemographic factors have strong effects on Internet
access and single status but weak effects on the use of Internet dating
services. The presence of computer literate users in social networks
increase the chances of Internet dating. The researchers found that
Internet dating is a ‘common mate selection strategy among the highly
selective subpopulation of single Internet users and may continue to
grow through social networks. Material and virtual elements of the
digital divide have direct and indirect effects on Internet
dating’.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_10]

Case studies and qualitative analyses revealed that filtering process is
developed by online users when it comes to online dating. Danielle Couch
and Pranee Liamputtong used a qualitative approach with 15 people who
use online dating took part in in-depth, online chat interviews. The
results showed that nearly all participants used more than one dating
site to seek partners. They also made use of email, chat and webcam to
qualify their potential partners. They utilized a variety of filters and
filtering processes before progressing to a face-to-face meeting.
‘Participants filtered using the text, photographs, chat, and webcam
opportunities available online, and followed progressive personalized
steps in communication and engagement in the lead-up to meeting other
online daters in person’.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_11]

Recent research reveals that online courtship has shifted to social
networks such as Facebook among youth. Craig and Wright found that
‘attitude similarity and social attraction may be important perceptions
that influence self-disclosure, and may eventually lead to
predictability and interdependence, both important outcomes in terms of
developing=maintaining relationships’.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_12] Perceptions of similarity
and attraction are found to be influencing two relational maintenance
strategies (positivity and openness). They also found out that many
Facebook users supplement their Facebook communications with
face-to-face interactions. Through these encounters, the online couples
take care of any potential misunderstandings.

## Deceptive Self-Presentation: A Psychological or A Security Issue?

Misrepresentation has been, and it still is the most studied phenomenon
in online dating. Ellison et al explore how users conceptualize
misrepresentation (their own and others’) in a specific genre of online
self-presentation: the online dating profile. Using qualitative data
collected from 37 online dating participants, the researchers tried to
understand self-presentational practices ‘specifically how discrepancies
between one’s online profile and offline presentation are constructed,
assessed, and justified’.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_13] New York City was chosen as the location
having access to a variety of online dating site users. Participants
were invited through the *Village Voice* and Craigslist.com
advertisements. Users of the most popular online dating sites (Yahoo!
Personals, Match.com/MSN Match.com, American Singles, and Webdate) were
included in the study. Overall eighty participants took part in the
study. The first thirty-seven were interviewed (12 men and 25 women)
ranging in age from 18 to 47. The near ethnographic field work yielded
interesting results:

> First, participants were presented with a printed copy of their online
> dating profile and asked to rate the accuracy of each profile element,
> as well as the general acceptability of lying on that topic. Profile
> elements included age, height, occupation, and religion. Participants
> then completed a survey and were interviewed by the third author.
> Finally, participants were asked to engage in measurement procedures
> and were thanked, debriefed, and given a \$30 incentive.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_14]

The end result showed that online daters used their profile as a promise
when it came to creating their own online representation: The
participants gave themselves ‘a flexible sense of identity that drew
upon past, present, and future selves. The profile as promise framework
enables us to better understand these dynamics and to consider when a
misrepresentation is a lie and when it is merely a promise that may soon
be fulfilled’.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_15]

Toma and Hancock (2010) examined the role of online daters’ deception in
physical attractiveness in their profiles. Sixty-nine online daters
identified the deceptions in their online dating profiles and had their
photograph taken in the lab. Independent judges rated the online daters’
physical attractiveness. Results showed that the online daters were to
change their profile photographs and lie about their physical
description (height, weight, age) when they had low self esteem. The
relationship between attractiveness and deception did not extend to
profile parts unrelated to their physical appearance such as income,
occupation, suggesting that their deceptions were limited and
strategic.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_16]

Uncertainty plays a role in building trust in intimacy. Toma and
Hancock’s further study investigated whether deceptions in online dating
profiles match what daters write about themselves in the text part of
the profile. Computerized analyses found that deceptions showed
themselves through linguistic cues pertaining to liars’ emotions and
liars’ strategic efforts to manage their self-presentations. The
findings add to the research base on deception, media, and
self-presentation, and also show how writing style influences perceived
trustworthiness.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_17]

Toma, Hancock and Ellison (2008: 1023) examined self-presentation in
online dating profiles using a novel cross-validation technique for
establishing accuracy. Eighty online daters rated the accuracy of their
online self-presentation. Information about participants’ physical
attributes was then collected (height, weight, and age) and compared
with their online profile, revealing that deviations tended to be
ubiquitous but small in magnitude. Men lied more about their height, and
women lied more about their weight, with participants farther from the
mean lying more. Participants’ self-ratings of accuracy were
significantly correlated with observed accuracy, suggesting that
inaccuracies were intentional rather than self-deceptive. Overall,
participants reported being the least accurate about their photographs
and the most accurate about their relationship information. This study
conflicts with previous studies that

On the other hand, Deandrea et al confirmed that online daters lied
about their weight and height not to create social desirability. The
study found that ‘height/weight misstatements are self-serving but do
not serve a social influence strategy to affect others’ impressions’.
The self-deception literature shows that distorted self-presentations
can represent simple ignorance about oneself, a strategic message to
deceive others, or a self-directed response to self-affirmation or the
avoidance of threats to self-esteem.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_18]

Kraeger et al questioned the tendency for spouses to resemble each other
across a variety of valued social characteristics, such as income,
education, and health. The idea was to check if homogamy played an
important role in the creation of intergroup social distance, inequality
among families, and the intergenerational transmission of
(dis)advantage.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_19] Hall et al examined factors found that seven
categories of misrepresentation exist: ‘personal assets, relationship
goals, personal interests, personal attributes, past relationships,
weight, and age’. The study found that men are more likely to
misrepresent personal assets, relationship goals, personal interests,
and personal attributes, whereas women are more likely to misrepresent
weight.[^3_Akser_OldandNewMethodsforOnlineResearch-rev_20]

## Conclusion

The research literature on online dating has mostly concentrated on two
strands of research: on who uses these services and why-how
misrepresentation of self happens. The early assumptions of who were the
shy people used online dating to their advantage. Yet further studies
revealed that more aggressive, and less shy people overly use these
services. As for the misrepresentation each study conflicted with
another. The physical qualities were thought to be determining
misrepresentation. Yet money and status were mist lied about by men. The
variety of research methods used such as questionnaire and online
surveys seem to be more reliable that computerized aggregate analyses.
The future of online dating studies is yet to be determined by a new
factor, the use of social networks. Such networks can change the
assumptions and the actual uses of these sites in unpredictable ways.
The online dating services are big, and the services they provide are on
demand. The next decade of online dating research will questions today’s
assumptions and give way to a better understanding of online romance.
