# 'Dating' or 'Escaping'? Cuban Profiles in Dating Websites

### LÁZARO M. BACALLAO PINO

## Introduction

Cuba has one of the lowest Internet access rates in Latin America.
Despite the uncertainty in the available statistics of Internet
access,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_1] most sources agree in placing the island among the countries
with the lowest rate of access in the Western Hemisphere.

For instance, according to the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/),
14.3 of every 100 Cubans were users of the Internet in 1999. This figure
rose to 15.9 in 2010, reaching 23.2 per 100 inhabitants in 2011 and 25.6
in 2012.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_2] The [International Telecommunication
Union](http://www.itu.int/es/Pages/default.aspx) (ITU), based on 2010
data, showed that there were 40,097 fixed Internet subscriptions in
Cuba; it means, 0.36 fixed Internet subscriptions per 100
inhabitants.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_3] Meanwhile, according [United
Nations](http://www.un.org/en/) (UN), based on July 2013 data, there
were 9.76 Cuban users of Internet per 100 inhabitants in 2005, 11.16 in
2006, 11.69 in 2007, 12.94 in 2008, 14.33 in 2009, 15.9 in 2010, 23.23
in 2011 and 25.64 in 2012, but the UN clarifies that, for example, in
2010, only 2.9 % of the 1,702, 206 users had Internet access.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_4]
Officially, according to the Cuban government, there were 724,000
personal computers in Cuba in 2011, and the 65% of them were connected
to networks of data with Internet access.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_5]

Besides this, the prices of Internet access are extraordinarily high.
For example, in June 2013, the government opened 118 public centers for
Internet access that offers three kind of services at three different
prices: 4.50 USD per hour of full Internet access; 1.50 USD per hour of
access to the national intranet network, plus international email
access; and 0.60 USD per hour of access to the national intranet
network. As a Cuban blogger explained to the Spanish newspaper [El
País](http://www.elpais.com/), the price of an hour of Internet access
“is roughly equivalent to what I spend in a week on eating”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_6]

In such a scenario, where Internet access is not only a real privilege
but almost an impossible action for most people, does it make sense to
have a profile on a dating website? Moreover, what would be the purpose
of a profile of this type and how does the context of accessibility
influence their characteristics and dynamics? But, besides that specific
digital context, there is a particular Cuban socio-political environment
regarding the Internet access, characterized by the official emphasis on
a “social use” of the World Wide Web, providing Internet access mainly
from universities, official media and other governmental institutions,
it is, from institutions and activities related to education, research,
governmental politics and media. Then, another relevant question would
be: does such an over politicization of the use of Internet and that
“social” perspective of it mediate its private uses in the case of Cuban
profiles in online dating sites? If yes, how does it mediate the
discourses and practices of the users?

These issues are added to the existing debates on dating websites,
particularly those related to the user behaviour, the presentation of
the self on Internet dating sites, the narratives and attractiveness of
the profiles, the veracity in online dating self-representations and the
interrelationships between truth and lie on it, or the comparisons
between online dating and conventional offline dating. For instance,
whether online dating dynamics are fundamentally different from offline
ones, or if it promotes better romantic outcomes. All those issues are,
in the Cuban case, mediated by the above mentioned specificities of the
context. We aim to analyze that mediation: how does it influence the
configuration of the profiles, to what extend that mediation plays a
central role in the dynamics of online courtship, or its presence in the
narratives and representations mobilized on the profiles.

## Methods and Techniques of Research

The analysis of online dating websites sets a number of methodological
challenges. The complexity of the issue recommends a qualitative
approach, mainly based on the discourse analysis of the profiles and,
when possible, email interviews with the users.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_7] A qualitative
perspective is appropriate for the proposed analysis, since it offers an
insider's view of the subject of research and descriptions that suggest
possible interrelationships, explain causes and effects and describe
dynamic processes.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_8] The importance of the context for qualitative
research and its holistic perspective[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_9] -seeing the experience as a
whole-, and its interpretative approach[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_10] are also significant for
the theme to be examined, due to the singularities of the scenario of
research, both digital and sociopolitical ones. At the same time, the
flexibility and contextualized way in which should be conducted
qualitative research, as well as its critical enquiry approach,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_11]
will permit to deal with the inherent complexity of the topic of
research.

Since there are no specifically Cuban websites for online dating, we
will analyze Cuban profiles at two international dating websites:
[Connectingsingles.com](http://www.connectingsingles.com/) and
[Datehookup.com](http://www.datehookup.com/). We will also include the
only Cuban classified ads site, called
[Revolico.com](http://www.revolico.com/).[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_12] As we will see, although
it is not a dating website, and it does not have a particular section of
dating or contacts, we can find a few announcements of that kind. Its
inclusion will allow us to have a case to compare Cuban profiles in
dating websites with listings of contact with a more explicit sexual
purpose, which is relevant for the analysis of the first.

## Mediation of 'the Cuban Condition' in Profiles from Cuba in Dating Websites

Relationships between real and virtual worlds -or, better, between the
social, cultural, economic and political context of individuals and
their behaviours in digital scenarios- have been a critical topic of
research in the field of the appropriations of information and
communication technologies (ICTs). From the distinction among “virtual
reality” and “real virtuality on its complex interrelationships and the
proposal of “real virtuality” as the specificity of ICTs,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_13] to the
exam of the implications of mapping the social onto the digital and vice
versa, or the study of the efficacy of digital connectivity on some
specific social practices and its articulation with other social
networks,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_14] there is a really extensive and multidimensional field of
research on these relationships.

In this study, the analysis of the context is a relevant dimension,
given the scenario from which Cuban profiles in dating websites are
generated. This Cuban condition has both a specific technological
dimension – previously described on its general aspects-, and a
socio-economic and political one.

Since the 90s, Cuban society is experiencing a deep crisis whose origin
is in the fall of socialism in the Soviet Union and the important
consequences it had on special for the Cuban economy, beginning what was
named the “Special Period”, characterized by serious real-life economic
problems, especially a significant scarcity of products, increasing
prices and a loss of the real value of the national currency. In
macro-economic terms,

> the end of economic aid and drastic reduction in commerce with the
> vanished socialist camp, preceded by errors and frequent changes in
> domestic economic policies, caused a 35% drop in GDP between 1989 and
> 1993, a 78% decrease in real social expenditures per capita, an
> increase in unemployment to 8%, and a deterioration in social
> indicators.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_15]

Although according to some economic analyses there was a period of
economic upturn between 2011 and 2008, internal factors and the global
economic crisis have hit Cuban economy, affecting macro-economic
indicators, such as a severe slowdown in growth and the contraction of
external financing. As a result, Cuba's social assistance programme has
deteriorated, in a process reinforced by the key weaknesses in the
provision of social services. The new scenario has had the adverse
social effects and there is a consensus on the governmental incapacity
to sustain the growing cost of social services in the future.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_16]

That economic climate generates a number of social phenomena, such as
the low labour motivation in those jobs with no access to incomes in
Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC),[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_17] an important activity in the
underground economy, a significant migration of skilled and university
professionals who also shifted their state occupations to low skill jobs
in enterprises with foreign capital or in tourism that provide formal or
informal access to CUC, a decrease interest of the younger generation in
higher education, or the increase of tourist-based dollar prostitution,
practised even by university educated women and men.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_18]

Besides that economic context and its social consequences, the Cuban
scenario is also characterized by a singular political climate -just one
legal party system, the governing Communist Cuban Party, the lack of
legal recognition to the political opposition, or the state ownership of
the media-, and, what is more relevant to the analysis, an extensive and
permanent state intervention and impediment on social practices. Even
the Cuban highest rulers have recognized that “the State does not have
to get into anything that is attempting to regulate the relationships
between individuals”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_19]

However, in Cuba there were a number of prohibitions as the buying and
selling of homes or private cars, or the need of an official permission
to travel abroad, which are being gradually eliminated and which are
clear examples of the excessive state intervention in the private lives
of individuals. But, instead of a total regime of social control, some
authors have argued that the system's effectiveness is based on formal
and informal social control mechanisms that “simultaneously emphasize
openness and rigidity”,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_20] combining both freedom and restraint.

In this technological, economic and sociopolitical context, it is not
surprising that there are really few Cuban profiles on dating websites.
Difficulties on access to Internet -due to the low level of Internet
penetration, as well as the high prices- become, at first instance, a
barrier that impedes the regular Internet access of individuals. But,
precisely because of this circumstance, the presence of those few
profiles is a significant symptom of the resistance to those obstacles
and the great interest of the users to access this type of websites. In
a context signed by the (ghost of a) permanent and ubiquitous social
surveillance -and, consequently, also a digital one-, the act of having
a profile in a dating website becomes an explicit defiance to any
control. But, unlike the public and more explicitly political defiance
set for instance by the blogs created by independent journalists-, this
is a defiance from the individual and private dimension. There are no
direct references to political issues in Cuban profiles in online dating
websites.

A total of 135 Cuban profiles were found in the online dating websites
analysed. Of this total, 59.26% are profiles of men (looking for a woman
or another man) and 40.74% are women (looking for a man). These low
figures and the low frequency of connecting users confirm the
difficulties in accessing the Internet. In the case of women, only 9.09%
were active within the last 24 hours, 29.09% were active within four
weeks and the rest (61.82%) were active over one month ago. Meanwhile,
in the case of men’s profiles, 6.25% were active within the last 24
hours, 28.75% of them were active within four weeks and the rest (65%)
were active over one month ago.

To this low frequency of access, another fact is added: the Cuban
profiles are found only in those dating websites that offer a completely
free service. Here the economic dimension has an explicit influence on
that trend, coherently with the before described economic scenario and
the high prices of Internet access. The economic dimension has then a
direct effect on one of the most important aspects linked to the uses of
ICTs: the immediacy and even the permanent connectivity, increased
worldwide by the Internet access from smartphones.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_21] Aware of the
necessity of that continuity, Cuban users with profiles in online dating
sites include in some cases other contact information –such as email
addresses or even telephone numbers-, maybe foreseeing the possibility
of losing temporarily -or even permanently- their Internet access.

Privacy has been one of the most important concerns of Internet users
from the first moments of the World Wide Web to current social
networks.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_22]Then, it is particularly relevant that some users provide
private data such as email or telephone, especially because the open and
free nature of the websites they select. This allows anyone, even
without being a member of the site, to access that information. Here,
the Cuban condition becomes, at the same, the cause of the need to
provide private data publicly, but also, according to the subjects, a
certain source of protection against this situation. Asked about it, a
Cuban woman with a profile in one of those sites considers that since
“almost no one in Cuba has access to the Internet, it is difficult for
me to be bothered by Cubans. Besides, nobody will call to Cuba from
abroad if he has no real interest, because phone calls are very
expensive”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_23]

The Cuban condition - mainly its technological dimension and the
difficult Internet access- becomes this way a source of safety, at least
in the opinion of the subjects. But, while some individuals make public
their private data, other ones even prefer not to publish his/her
pictures. Among woman, 21.82% of them does not include a picture on
their profiles, while 23.75% of men's profiles does not have photos.
None of the users without picture answered the question about why they
not include it in their profiles, however, it could be deduced that this
decision is related to the preservation of privacy and personal
identity.

Profiles photographs are “a central component of online
self-presentation, and one that is critical for relational
success”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_24] As previous studies have demonstrated, users prefer to
look at a profile that contains a picture, that also are contacted about
seven times more often than those that do not have it.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_25] Cubans
profiles in the analysed dating websites confirm this importance, since
none of the profiles without photos have friends and either comments,
that are possible only if associated to pictures in the case of
[Connectingsingles.com](http://www.connectingsingles.com/).

While the absence of pictures in some profiles could be understood as a
strategy against social control “inside” Cuba, the fact that the
majority of Cuban profiles are in English -only five of them are in
Spanish-, confirms there is an explicit “outside” projection and it
proves that they are mainly looking for a relationship with a foreigner.
In some cases, there is an explicit call for “some person” who can be
“interested in come to Cuba”[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_26] to meet singles; in other cases, it
says that there is a particular special interest in a certain country so
the person have interest in meeting people from that country: “I am
searching for friendship and something else, I love Finland and I want
to meet people there”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_27] Here the inside/outside divide does not have
(only) a technological nature but a socio-economic and even geographical
one. In fact, that orientation towards daters located outside Cuba shows
the strength of that divide, bringing to our minds the -poetically
speaking-, “damned circumstance of water everywhere”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_28]

But beyond that poetic image, the relationship of Cuban people with the
“outside” has been complex since 1959. The triumph of the Cuban
Revolution marks a different and rich pattern for studying external
migration processes and their relationships with political and social
conflicts. The main destination of Cuban emigration after 1959 has been
the United States and the phenomenon has been characterized by different
migration crisis (1959-60, 1980, 1994). Some authors have argued that
Cuban emigration, usually interpreted as a political exile, has moved
towards a process of economic nature and associate to family
reunification.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_29] An analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics
of Cuban migrant shows that, in the case of legal migration, there is a
balanced ratio between males and females (53% and 47% respectively),
while in the case of illegal departures, about 80 % are men. Other
important tendencies are the predominance of young people between
illegal Cuban migrants as well as the increasing educational level of
migrating people.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_30]

Besides the geographical condition -an island, isolated, that naturally
marks the difference between inside and outside spaces- and the peculiar
relevance of the migratory process after 1959, there are other
circumstances that reinforce that inside/outside differentiation. For
instance, the restrictions on travel abroad for Cuban citizens, slightly
flexibilized by the reform of immigration policy in January 2013. Cubans
are located -at least in the official discourse- outside capitalism. In
such a context, the inside/outside divide becomes a matter of real and
practical sense, expressed -in the case of profiles in dating websites-
in the clear and even explicit orientation towards foreigners as
potential partners.

Given the difficulties of access to the Internet, it does not seem to
make sense that Cuban people use these kind of websites for dating
between them. As a woman confesses, “it makes no sense to seek Cuban
partner through these sites. Very few of us have access to Internet. […]
I will not spend money on Internet access to find a Cuban man”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_31] In
conclusion, both the economic dimension and the technological one play a
central role in the perspective from which the Cubans become members of
dating websites. Internet access limitations and economic difficulties
restrict the possibilities of having a profile in that kind of sites,
focusing -when it is possible to access it- in foreigners as main target
group. Having a profile in dating websites could be seen, then, as a
certain kind of investment.

That outside or foreigner-oriented tendency is confirmed or reinforced
by the presence of a number of profiles of women or men who declare to
work at the sector of tourism. That is, they are people who are in
regular contact with foreigners, as part of their daily work. This
circumstance explains, on one hand, that these people have income levels
that would allow them to access the Internet and, in the other hand,
that they have perhaps more real chances to aspire to find a foreign
partner. A person who works in that sector would have, probably, a more
foreigner-oriented attitude, so having a profile in a dating website
would be a complementary way for meeting people from abroad.

At some point, the interrelationships between personal and commercial
interests even become absolute. We can find a profile that belongs not
to a person, but to an enterprise: a private tourist agency called Club
Friendship Cuba. The profile includes a full physical description (age,
height, body type, ethnicity, religious or marital status), since these
data are required to create a profile, but in fact the profile is used
for advertising the services offered by a private company, in a context
where there is no access to that resources for this kind of enterprises,
given the state monopoly in the sector. Something unimaginable in
another context -the creation of a profile on a dating site by a company
to advertise it-, it shows, in an extreme way, the uniqueness of the
appropriation that Cubans do of this kind of websites and its clearly
external orientation, as part of an inside/outside divide.

## Self-representation of Cuban Profiles in Dating Websites

Self-representation is a critical issue for profiles in online dating,
as previous studies have demonstrated.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_32] That authors have noted, for
instance, the complex interrelationships between the individuals'
concerns with a favourable self-representation as well as a good
impression, and a less honest behaviour in configuring their profiles,
controlling their self-disclosure by presenting themselves in a more
positive way and being less inclined to reveal what could be considered
a negative aspect. With this being said, there is an intentional process
of construction of a profile based on a more deliberate, controlled, and
perhaps idealized self-presentation, taking advantage of the reduced
cues and asynchronous nature of computer-mediated communication
(CMC).[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_33]

This intentional construction of the self is associated to a tendency
towards having more strategic success, benefiting those users whose
profiles are more attractive, desirable, and even idealized as a result
of their process of configuration. This behaviour leads us to a
particularly relevant issue: the relationships between truth and
falsehood in building profiles on dating websites or, in other terms,
the deception of the process, defining it from a broad point of view, as
“the intentional misrepresentation of information”, that “can take a
variety of forms, from outright lying to exaggeration”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_34] In fact, as
the study conducted by those authors points out, deception is a frequent
trend in users of dating websites, since about 81% of them lied on at
least one of the assessed variables (height, weight and age). However,
with few exceptions, most of the subjects altered the information in a
very slight way, as if it were acceptable to do so only to a certain
point.

Certainly, the aforementioned characteristics of the CMC facilitate, to
some point, the deception, since individuals are aware of it and, at the
same time, they want to create attractive self-presentations since they
are trying to manage the impressions they create in the other users
through the profiles they construct.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_35] But, in reality, certain level
of deception crosses all social interactions, as a practice of package
and edition of the self in order to favourably impress the others.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_36]
It becomes, this way, an everyday praxis and, therefore, the other
individuals are prevented about it (since, probably, they follow the
same scheme of quotidian action).

Given that general (theoretical) scenario, it is relevant to examine the
narratives mobilized by -and the specificities of- Cuban profiles in
dating websites: descriptions presented, topics underlined, values
declared, dimensions highlighted, or issues not revealed. The
foreigners-oriented nature of the Cuban profiles in dating websites
would become a core mediation in the narratives used for the
construction of profiles and, consequently, in the self-presentation
they do.

It seems that users are aware of the possible image that people from
abroad can have about intentions linked to prostitution or, at least, to
certain economic interest in those Cubans who create profiles in dating
websites. Given the articulation between economic scarcity, the raise of
tourism as activity during the 90s, and the increase of prostitution,
one of the most important issues faced by the subjects would be to
create a profile that moves away from any suspicion of prostitution or
economic interest, especially since they are profiles created with a
clear orientation towards foreigners as possible partners to meet.

While this is the tendency in sites such as
[Connectingsingles.com](http://www.connectingsingles.com/), in the case
of the announcements of contacts published in
[Revolico.com](http://www.revolico.com/), there are more direct and
explicit references to be looking for some kind of sexual service by
tourists or foreign residents in Cuba, or to be offering the service by
Cubans. Also in the case of this website there are very few ads of this
type but a higher percentage of them makes reference to that purpose.
Between January 1^st^ and February 28, 2014, a total of 2,786 ads were
published in the section “others”,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_37] at
[Revolico.com](http://www.revolico.com/), and only 14 of them were
related to searching for contacts or dating. Seven of those ads were
published by foreigners -tourists or residents in Cuba- who were looking
either for some “temporal companion” or escort during their travel to
Cuba. The other 50% of those announcements were published by Cuban
people looking for sexual encounters or offering their service as
escorts; any of them was looking for a formal relationship.

Since here the economic interest is explicit, then the self-presentation
of both the “costumers” and the “provider” of the services are direct in
those announcements: there is no need of hiding the existence of an
interest. Foreigners looking for escorts or a temporary companion then
emphasize aspects such as the age and physical characteristics of the
persons they are looking for, ask for the possibility of sending
pictures and underline their economic solvency. In turn, those who offer
themselves as escorts, not only highlight their attractiveness but also
they present themselves as nice, funny, serious people.

Contrary to this explicit statement of economic interest present in
announcements published at [Revolico.com](http://www.revolico.com/), in
the case of profiles on dating websites such as
[Connectingsingles.com](http://www.connectingsingles.com/), users try
precisely to avoid being seen as “interested” persons who are trying to
use some foreigner for “escaping” from Cuba by the way of marriage. In
that sense, they develop some narrative strategies and underline certain
aspects on their self-presentations that could be considered as common
scripts for creating an adequate image of the self.

Most of the Cuban profiles frequently highlight on their description a
number of personal human values, such as honesty, sincerity, generosity,
optimism, loyalty, happiness, modesty, seriousness and sensibility. This
long inventory of values also includes being studious, romantic, loving
and passionate. But, similarly to the self-presentation, those
characteristics are used also to describe the person they are looking
for: an affectionate one, a wonderful, genuine, working, true-hearted,
responsible, sweet, graceful, hopeful and good person. Definition of the
self can also be stated in terms of a confrontation between those things
that one loves -“altruism, comprehension, truth, smile to everybody, to
work and to be (in the future) good father and husband”- and the ones
hated -“injustice, hypocrisy, lies, treason, inequality, egoism,
dishonesty, vanity, lack of understanding and all kind of vices”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_38]
The image of perfection, in the case of men, reaches even to the point
of trying to avoid seeming a male chauvinist, saying that he is “able to
make any woman happy, [since] especially I like to cook and help my
partner”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_39]

There is a certain continuity between the description of the self and
the description of the person wanted to de found: “I am an honest man
and I am looking for an special woman like me”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_40] Consistently, an
almost perfect person -according to her/his self-presentation- then will
desire to meet the perfect man/woman, “a person who also wants to find
the perfect match”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_41] Here the self and the otherness go together as
part of that narrative strategy in the construction of profiles.

Coherently with those descriptions, <span id="result_box"
class="anchor"></span>there are a number of themes that recurs in the
Cuban profiles. One theme is romanticism: most profiles state their
desire of finding the true love: “I am here waiting to find my love, I
know that is so difficult but not impossible, in somewhere there is this
special love”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_42] Usually, profiles include some romantic scenes on
their characterisation, such as the commonplace of "to watch the sunset"
or “to see the Moon together”, or “to take nice walks together”,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_43]
“the stars shining, the birds flying, the sea, the mountains, a blue
sky, fresh air […] we must take advantage from these pleasant things
everyday as a last time”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_44]

At the same time, they usually underline the seriousness of their
purpose, highlighting that they are looking for “a serious
relationship”. There are explicit mentions of the possibility of
marriage and future plans, including to have a family, as well as
references to not being on the dating website “to play bad games or help
scammers to do their work”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_45] “I am looking for a man to build a
stable relationship and give him all of me. Please I would like to
receive messages only from people who are interested in looking for a
serious relationship in a long term”,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_46] states a profile, while other
says that his plans is “to be a good father a a good husband in the
future”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_47] In that sense, someone confesses -underlining his
intention to find a longterm relationship as well as the importance of
feelings-, that currently he has no girlfriend because is “tired of
meaningless, just physical, short relationships”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_48]

Another frequent issue included in self-presentations is the
incorporation of elements for making the profiles more “human”. This
way, some profiles include personal details such as the sons and
daughters the person has, or mention that his/her parents have passed
away and s/he is “alone in my country”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_49] In other cases, when
explaining the reasons for creating a profile, there are references to
certain personal situation involving precisely a previous painful
relationship: “I am in this site because I am going through a very
difficult step of my relationship, the broke-up”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_50] This way,
self-presentations include touching stories that not only would humanize
profiles, but could also generate compassion and a desire to help in
those people reading it. In that sense, a woman describe the person she
is looking for as “someone that enjoys a good joke as well as sharing
the problems in life”,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_51] in a clear reference to the well-known
phrase of the marriage ceremony: “in good times, in bad, for richer, for poorer, in
sickness and in health”.

Communicational dimension is another question included in some profiles,
both in self-presentation and in the description of the person looking
to meet. Thus, individuals
are described as talkative persons, wanting to “meet people that love to
have a conversation, by email, phone or whatever”,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_52] “someone
friendly that enjoys communication”[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_53] or “a sincere person, easy to
talk to, [who] takes as well as gives from a relation”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_54] Also men include that
dimension on their description, considering that one of the most
important thing in a couple “must be communication for all agreement,
plans, preferences, and ways to go, all in all…to be as a same
person”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_55] This is not surprising, since those websites are,
precisely, a space of communicative nature where, in the first instance,
a communicative relationship will be established between subjects. Then,
that dimension would be central for the relations by these ICTs-based
resources.

All those aspects -romanticism, serious purposes, future plans, and so
on- are elements of a narrative strategy for avoiding any possible
association to prostitution, a likely trend since Cubans profiles focus
specifically towards foreigners as potential partners. As part of that
effort, it is also relevant that only two profiles answer the question
about incomes, included in the data to be completed as part of the
profile, and just one profile refers to the well-established position of
the person on her career and her position of financial security, “with a
job I enjoy”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_56] On the other side, in some case, there is an explicit
reference to the economic dimension, but denying any interest: “I don't
have money and I am not here looking for money”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_57] Although some
authors have suggested that those persons involved in prostitution in
Cuba -called *jineteras* and *jineteros*- do not identify themselves as
prostitutes but “as being *en la lucha* (being in the struggle of daily
survival to procure essential food and goods) or simply *resolviendo*
(taking care of daily basic needs due to the scarcity of consumer goods
in the island)”, there is a consistent strategy and a narrative effort
in Cuban profiles at dating websites for avoiding any association with
prostitution or economic interest.

Besides the mediation of that dimension in the self-presentation of Cuba
profiles, the other aspect that is explicit mentioned by a number of
users is the technological one. It is also used as an argument for
reinforcing the seriousness of the profile's purposes. For instance, the
difficulties for accessing Internet are mentioned, explaining that “we
have not time on-line for a game”,[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_58] telling this way that s/he is
looking for something “real” and serios. Another profile explains that
“I also have troubles in the Internet connection. I am not all the time
online, and it’s difficult for me to chat online, due to the limited
economic resources of my country as well. For Cubans it’s forbidden
Skype or webcam chat”.[^6_Pino_Dating_or_Escaping_59] This way, the technological aspect is
included as part of the self-presentation, both for underlining the
limitations of the CMC in the case of Cubans profiles -an important
issue, since average users expect to pass from the exchange of messages
by those websites to some more multimedia communication, such as chat or
Skype, before definitely passing to a face-to-face scenario-, and for
insisting in the seriousness of the individual's purposes.

## Conclusions

Self-presentation in Cuban profiles on dating websites are mediated by
the Cuban condition, particularly its technological and socio-economical
and political dimensions. Given the difficulties for Internet access and
the economic situation, the are few Cuban profiles in those kind of
websites and they are present mainly in those ones that offer a complete
free service. This circumstance sets a particularly challenge to them,
since all the information is available even for those persons who do not
have a profile on these websites, creating a dilemma regarding privacy.
This dilemma, however, is only explicit in a few profiles that prevent
to post pictures, while most of them even include information such as
mobile numbers, in order to facilitate communication in a context where
losing the Internet connection is a permanent possibility.

There is a clear and significant difference between those announcements
offering or demanding sexual services that recognize it, and those
profiles in dating websites that, to the contrary, try to avoid any
suspicion of economic interest or link with prostitution, as well as
avoid any possible perception that their intention is to use a foreign
persons to “escape” from the island. Given that the majority of Cuban
profiles in dating websites have a clear orientation towards foreigners
as potential partners; this outside-direction can easily be associated
to some economic interest or association with prostitution practices.
That is why the economic dimension is carefully avoided or explicitly
denied by some profiles.

All narrative strategies in self-presentation aim to avoid that
association, building an ideal, almost perfect image of both the self
and the other that is being sought. Precisely, one of the arguments used
to underline the serious purposes of the person behind the profile, is
the difficulty for accessing the Internet; it is, the technological
dimension. It also limits the possibilities of passing from the exchange
of messages by the dating website to other ICTs-based channels of
multimedia communication, such as Skype. That limitation could probably
be associated also to the effort made for building a more convincing
self-presentation.

Human values included in the description, the emphasis on feelings or
the recurring romantic images, all of it are elements of the narrative
strategy developed for an ideal presentation of the self in Cuban
profiles, to the point that sometimes there could be a certain suspicion
about some exaggerations or even lies in the image of the self
presented. It is relevant that such a private use of Internet does not
include any reference to the context of social control and hegemonic
perspective of a social use of Internet. Here the overpoliticization of
Internet, a permanent issue in other communicative spaces from Cuba such
as independent blogs, is silenced.

Instead of references to political issues in the presentation of self,
it is preferred to present a description that explains why Cubans do not
consider dating websites as resources for looking for a relationship
with other inhabitants of the island and they focus their profiles
towards foreigners as potential partners. In that sense, as we have
seen, the technological dimension -articulated with the economic issue-
becomes the core mediation in the presentation of the self by Cubans in
dating websites, both on its content and its dynamics.
