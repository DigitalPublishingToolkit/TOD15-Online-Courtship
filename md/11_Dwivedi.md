# From Arranged to Online: A Study of Courtship Culture in India

### AMITABH VIKRAM DWIVEDI

## Introduction

This chapter is a result of an ethnographic study conducted between
January and March 2014 for three online matrimonial sites. It studied
the factors responsible for the online culture prevalent in Indian
marriages. Nothing much has been changed in marriages and promises
across cultures in India. Earlier they were arranged now they are
arranged online, too. Traditionally, Indian families had a great deal of
involvement in the marriage processes. Those marriages were popularly
known as ‘*arranged marriages’.* Now this culture has been supported by
an online courtship culture where two online searchers initiate on
commercial matrimonial sites. Table 2 compares the offline generation to
the online generation in partner search. The goal of this study, began
in 2013, was to provide reliable and sound information with which to
identify how modern technology corresponds to societal traditions. This
research studies three sites, namely *shadi.com, jeevansahti.com* and
*bharatmatrimony.com* in India*,* and seeks to examine how these
matrimonial sites in the process of arranging marriages interact with
the partner seekers. Since the marriage processes and traditions are
closely associated with each other, there would be an exploration of how
modern technologies confront and consequently change societal
traditions. The study is informed by the ethnographic approach, and the
information is analyzed by feedback and content analysis. This study
does not promote or reject online or offline ways of selecting a
prospective partner but it gives an insight where technology is changing
complex social process.

Matrimonial sites that assist in arranging marriages were founded by the
young Indian entrepreneurs a couple of decades ago. In 1996, Anupam
Mittal pioneered online matrimonial by founding *Shaadi.com* and he
claims that this website has affected the lives of 20 million people and
3.2 million people found their life partners on this site.[^11_Dwivedi_1] *Bharat
Matrimony*, founded in 1997, holds the *Limca Book of World Record* for
the highest number of online documented marriages and also set a
*Guinness World Record* for creating the Largest Wedding Photo Album on
April 14, 2012.[^11_Dwivedi_2] *Jeevansahti.com*, a recent establishment, has
850,000 members, and it finds a match primarily on the basis of
community, religion, caste, and profession.[^11_Dwivedi_3]

In India every state has its own type of wedding ceremonies with mostly
diverse customs and traditions. Some typical Indian weddings include the
Punjabi wedding, Hindu wedding, Indian Muslim wedding and Christian
wedding. The ways marriages are organized keep changing in India.
Earlier there were only arranged marriages in the same caste and
religion. Now there is love, love-arranged, arranged-love, inter-caste,
inter-religion, court-marriage and live-in relationship. Moreover, most
of these marriages are arranged online.

This chapter addressed the following research questions:

1. What is the magnitude of modern technology against the societal traditions in India?
Especially, on these three online matrimonial sites, how do they
penetrate in the complex social practices confrontational or
supplementary to old traditional searching practices?

2. How do family and individual differ in their opinions for searching
a partner?

3. What technological, individual, and family factors are associated
with the online searching practices?

This study has three components: a. Assessing trends and patterns of
online marriages by studying three matrimonial sites and analyzing
existing data sets; b. Conducting interview-based surveys to increase
the understanding of changing behaviors of the users of the matrimonial
sites; and c. Distilling findings from an analysis of
participant-observation and telephone interviews.

This chapter actively admits that though online searching environment
complements the traditional offline markets, it seeks to explore how the
change and difference related to the online activities in the marriages
is carried out, and recounts how the knowledge of the technology and
social action go together. The remainder of the chapter is organized
under the following headings: “Arranged Marriages” describes the
historical background of marriages in India, “Online Searchers”
specifies participants of this study, under the “Theoretical Foundation”
a brief account of previous studies conducted is presented and the
impact of technology on searching partners is discussed, the next
section “How Matrimonial Sites Work” provides an overview of the
matrimonial sites, “Facilities on Matrimonial Sites” enumerates the
technical reasons for the success of these sites in India, “Methodology”
discusses various methods used for the study, the heading “Analysis”
indicates the behavior of the users and abusers on these sites, and the
heading “Conclusion” concludes the paper, finally the “Limitations”
enumerates a few limitations of this research.

## Arranged Marriages

Ancient Indian text *Manusmriti,* or *The Writings of Manu*, identifies
the marriage ceremony as a rite of initiation for women, by which they
became the members of Hindu society.[^11_Dwivedi_4] Manu says that “the nuptial
ceremony is considered as the complete institution of women, ordained
for them in the Veda, together with the reference to their
husbands.”[^11_Dwivedi_5] No traditional Indian text prescribes requisite to be in
love first before marriage as it is against the constitution of the
marriage institution in ancient India[^11_Dwivedi_6]. However, there were instances
when marriages followed love, or at times a child was born out of the
wedlock in love.[^11_Dwivedi_7]

The compound lexeme ‘arranged marriages’ gives a vague picture of
obedient sons and daughters who cannot select a partner for themselves
and therefore their parents generally arrange their marriages. But
fairly this can be seen as men and women seek each other and their
parents endorse the wedding, and in some cases the “groom’s family may
ask for a dowry of cash and other items.”[^11_Dwivedi_8] The stamp provided by the
parents also approves only such arranged marriages where traditional
ideologies pertaining to female chastity, prohibition of inter-caste and
inter-religion marriages are maintained, and issues of elopements,
conversions and remarriages are properly taken care of.[^11_Dwivedi_9]

Arranging marriages are a socio-economic decision for the parents of the
brides and grooms. Both the parties who participate in this
transactional institution try to secure their profits in this social
investment. With or without dowry after *Kanyadan*,[^11_Dwivedi_10] where the
father of the bride gives the hand of her daughter to the groom, the
woman becomes the life-partner and responsibility of the man. This
important decision of marriage is made after matching the social,
economic, cultural, and educational equality. The major critique of love
marriages crops up from the fact that it promotes inter-caste marriages
and consequently weakens the society. The caste system restores its
equilibrium even in the arranged online marriages where matrimonial
sites are classified under the headings of castes and sub-castes.

Generally, love follows marriage in arranged marriages.[^11_Dwivedi_11] The
pragmatic considerations for such marriages are that it will outlast the
quickly fading infatuation and romantic love.[^11_Dwivedi_12] In the colonial
period, the radical supporters of English culture, language and ideology
who were disgusted by the evil practices of Indian society, for example,
*Sati,* or self-immolation of a widow, child marriages, the prohibition
of widow remarriage, and questioning female chastity supported and
promoted the idea to be in love first and then to go for a marriage. The
Constitution of India provides various acts to regulate marriages in
this country with many religions. Muslim Personal Law Application Act
XXVI of 1937 and Indian Christian Marriage Act XV of 1872 regulate
Muslim and Christian marriages in modern India respectively.
Post-independence India witnessed Marriage Act of 1955 to curb child
marriages and dowry system, and Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists come
under this law.[^11_Dwivedi_13]

## Online Searchers

The online searchers largely consist of relatively computer-literate,
working middle class men and women who believe in finding their own
life-partners. They approve of the idea that though marriages are made
in heaven, they can be arranged online. Most of the eligible partner
seekers are single and some of them are migrated from their country,
states, cities, and towns in the search of jobs and better livelihood.
Their days are busy and nights are lonely, and they are quite assured
that they can find a better partner than their parents’ traditional
methods. The information age has impacted their psyche as much as they
want to be informed about everything related to their prospective
partners before they tie a knot. They want a confidential environment to
maximize their searches for the competent partner. Wagner says that
“people choose to use online dating services because they create
opportunities to meet people they would not have otherwise met.”[^11_Dwivedi_14]

Online partner searchers on matrimonial sites are of six types: married,
divorced, single, widowed, awaiting divorce, and annulled.


![Figure 1](imgs/Dwivedi-marriagetypes-01.jpg)

Figure 1 Online partner searchers

The online matrimonial sites work as a bridge in their search to place
them from a stage without a partner to where they have a partner. The
term divorced in Type 1, widowed in Type 2, annulled in Type 5, and
awaiting divorce in Type 6 are people who have experienced failure in
their previous marriages which was either love or arranged, offline or
online. The single in Type 3, generally refers to individuals who are
never married in their lives, and married in Type 4 consists of a mixed
group; they are either unhappy couples, couples living in distant
places, or boring couples interested in extra-marital relationships or
in a physical relationship. All six types are in search of love and
companionship which they have been lacking in their lives and
relationships.

The technology has advanced and changed the ways of selection, choice,
and consent for both brides and grooms. A study conducted by Bellou
shows that consumer broadband adaptation “has significantly contributed
to increased marriages rates among 21-30 year olds,” and the online
users search their partners until “a partner is found whose quality
equals or exceeds an endogenously determined reservation value.”[^11_Dwivedi_15]
These users are also the type of people who prefer to move in a
relationship from the virtual to the real world. In this process, they
enhance and invest their feelings by a gradual progress of
self-disclosure.

## Theoretical Foundation

The early research in the study of marriage was initiated by Becker’s *A
Theory of Marriage* in which he said that “marriage is compelling
additional evidence on the unifying power of economic analysis” and “a
market in marriages can be presumed to exist.”[^11_Dwivedi_16] His demand and
supply (D & C) model and optimal sorting models make an analogy between
marriages and firms. Since then D & C has been applied to the study of
dating, extra-marital affairs, and marriages. Bellou compares “the
market for romantic partners” with “the labor market”, and further
claims that both functions in a similar way.[^11_Dwivedi_17] Her study shows that broadband diffusion has a measurable impact on the online search
process.

Information Systems and Information Technology[^11_Dwivedi_18]  (IS/IT) have been fused in our day- to-day life and the expectations, promises, myths and
consequences birthed from this adopted wave have presented challenges to
the people, society and organization.[^11_Dwivedi_19] What the professional
matrimonial sites are doing today is a transformed version of match
searching which was earlier carried out by print media and the ‘family
pundits’ in the towns, villages, and cities of India. However, the
effects of new IS/IT are on its usage by the people rather than on the
technology itself, and the major challenge is whether to use it or leave
it. But the use of new technology depends on the interaction between the
technology, the user and the organizational environment. Communication
theorists argue that the use of technology is a process of social
definition. This, in turn, is related to the concept of
reinvention.[^11_Dwivedi_20] The new online technology of searching partners has
reinvented the themes of marriage, selection, choice, and companionship.

Wagner, in a qualitative study, investigates the communication phenomena
of deception as it occurs in the online dating, and concludes that
generally online daters are honest and a slight exaggeration and
dishonesty is mostly overlooked.[^11_Dwivedi_21] Besides this, the websites are
affecting more people. It is more popular in cities and metropolises. It
has redefined the complex social process of arranged marriages. Whitty
emphasizes that social scientists should not develop one grand theory to
explain how online users and searchers present themselves in the cyber
space, on the contrary, it is rather important to find how cyber space
is constructed.[^11_Dwivedi_22]

## How Matrimonial Sites Work

The online matrimonial sites generally work on the selective
dissemination of the information (SDI). An individual becomes an
information seeker and provider in the process of partner search. Seth
and Ravi suggest that “the use of matrimonial web sites have
implications for family disintermediation, cultural convergence,
continuous information flows, and ease of disengagement, virtual dating
and reduced stigma in arranged marriages in India.”[^11_Dwivedi_23]

The focus of the present study is the top-three matrimonial sites in
India, namely *Shaadi.com*, *Bharatmatrimony.com*, and
*Jeevansahti.com*. All three sites provide free registration, and have
common attributes like community specific search, online chat, email and
SMS services, horoscope matching, highlighted profile, time-bound
subscription, and personalized services.

The difference between a free registration and a paid membership lies in
the services and information the website provides. The significant
contacts and matches are always in the paid packages, and the customer
care executives give care and attention to any paid customer. It is
always advised and directed to the users to provide the correct and
complete information to attract better matches. The user provides
his/her basic information appertaining to age, sex, place and country of
birth, marital status, permanent and contact address, landline and
mobile phone numbers, email, etc. and the information related to
complexion, height, weight, and disorder if any. The user next fills the
information about job, education, life-style, and food preferences -
vegetarian or non-vegetarian.

## Facilities on Matrimonial Sites

The offline ways of searching partners are limited in scopes, while the
online matrimonial sites, assisted with the information dissemination
technology, facilities the online partner search. It penetrates the
complex Indian social structure, and makes the partner search a success.
Numerous matrimonial sites are operative in twenty-eight states and
seven union territories in India. Pal provides the list of such
twenty-two web sites and their global and Indian traffic ranks,
sites-linking and when they were founded.[^11_Dwivedi_24] The popularity of the
top-three matrimonial sites can be observed from the data on Alexa that
*Shaadi.com*’s traffic rank is No. 52 and each user spends at least 4.5
minutes on this site. While the traffic rank of Jeevansathi.com is 3,552
but each user spends more than 8 minutes per day. Table 1 indicates the
popularity of matrimonial sites in India as a potential partner
searcher.

The Peoples Interactive (I) Private Limited Company pioneered *Shaadi.com*
in 1996. This website develops its brand awareness by providing a
YouTube link of Indian best- seller *Chetan Bhagat’s* Marriage Tips for
Anupam Mittal, CEO of the company, and also trends videos showing a
superior matchmaking experience on *Shaadi.com*. It has 1.4 million likes
on Facebook and 42.2 thousand followers on Twitter in 2014/2013/1996? It
caters the increasing demand for matches by introducing and
supplementing Non-Residential Indians (NRI) matrimonial to the
traditional community and popular matrimonial. This service seems to
promote more security, transparency, and a complete control to customers
with a match guarantee challenge in 30 days otherwise they promise to
pay the refund of entire fee without question. The customers can also
follow the CEO on Twitter and on his blog. The SSL[^11_Dwivedi_25] encryption
technology secures the payment transactions and makes the customer’s
buying experience easier and more enjoyable. The plans start from three
months for \$62 to one year for \$170.

BharatMatrimony.com was probably the first to provide community-specific
searching experience in regional languages. Established in 1997,
*BharatMatrimony* believes to build a better *Bharat* (India) through
happy marriages. The company thinks that public relations can be more
effective if the native tongue of the online searchers is used.[^11_Dwivedi_26] The
website displays trendy advertisements in major regional languages,
namely Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, and Telugu. It
has 1.1 million likes on Facebook and 16.5 thousand followers on Twitter
2014 again, specify the time here. This is most trusted matrimony brand
according to the Brand Trust Report 2014.[^11_Dwivedi_27] It has launched two new
sections, namely assisted matrimony, a personalized match making
service, and elite matrimony, for the rich and affluent, to serve and
cover all types of online searchers. There are various paid packages
ranging from \$62 to \$615 with duration from three to nine months.
The website directs various payment options, for example, credit card,
debit card, net banking, and free door step collection. This matrimonial
site provides free SMS alerts and voice messages.

It is a recent venture of a job searching site *Naukari.com,* initiated
in September 2004, to serve northern and western Indian communities.
Jeevansathi.com provides up to one-year paid packages services starting
from US\$50 to US\$500. The company, along with regular registered
account, also advertizes the profiles of HIV positives, Thalassemia
Major, physically handicapped, and cancer survivors, for whom searching
a life partner is a challenge. This indicates how deeply technology
penetrates in the complex social structures.

## Methodology

The data for the study were collected through mixed methods, including
telephonic survey, face-to-face interview, analyzing Facebook messages,
and feedback and content available on the matrimonial sites. Feedback
included the real-life practices and experiences of the searchers which
were used to evaluate and analyze the various aspects of events. The
content analysis enabled the author to identify and examine themes and
trends in information gathered through the matrimonial sites. The
objectivity of this study is well-balanced as all the real participants
were not able to observe and influence the author.

The telephone survey conducted in Hindi and English in six states,
namely Jammu, Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar
Pradesh, in northern India from 5 January to 5 March 2014, among a
random representative sample of 100 respondents 24 years of age and
older. However, face-to-face communication[^11_Dwivedi_29] was very limited, and it
covered only the regions of Jammu and Kashmir with 20 respondents where
the author resides. This research also makes use of
participant-observation[^11_Dwivedi_30] method in the study. The data were
collected through 150 feedbacks, mostly testimonies of the users; and
content, such as 50 personal profiles, and 50 language samples on
matrimonial sites. The participants in the study had income between US\$1,500 and US\$5,000 per month. The interpretation of data was based
on how the use of new technology depends on the interaction between the
technology, the user and the organizational environment.

The success stories on websites are testimonials. They not only promote
the websites but also provide additional information such as the role of
family members, and the context of their selection of the website. The
investigation focused on the formation of profiles, the development of
the relationship during the courtship period, and the roles of relatives
and parents.

## Analysis: Users and Abusers

### Users

The changing trend of the Indian men and women in marriages has been
reflected from these matrimonial sites. Marriage is now not a closed
affair of a family where only a few members are included and aware of
the searching process. It has become a business of multinational
corporations. However, whether an individual should register an account
or not is still a family concern but many individuals open an account
without informing their parents. The family members and close friends
influence the selection process by providing their views, suggestions,
and opinions on looks, age, income, caste, community, complexion, and
horoscopes.

As soon as an account is open, it is virtually available to the world
unless the user has posed restrictions on the website. It proclaims that
an individual has registered himself/herself into the marriage market.
Anyone who has opened a paid account can view other users’ profile and
send messages either by an SMS, mail or in the chat box. However, the
elders (60 plus in age) of family still believe that online marriage
should be the last option available for men and women. They disapprove
it by saying that “only a person who is not getting married goes for
it”, “how do you know that your prospective partner is a virgin”,
“company is making a fool of you”, “how can you rely on a machine”, “how
can you make your personal bio-data public”, “we are still alive to find
a partner for you”, “don’t become so modern and western if anything goes
wrong company won’t interfere or solve”, alike.[^11_Dwivedi_31] Ironically, Indian
marriages depend on a “middleman.” This person (a relative, friend,
family-pundit, etc.) recommends the marriage and he/she is largely
responsible for the success of the relationship. If any conflict or
dispute occurs it is his/her responsibility to solve it tactfully.

But despite these subjective criticisms the fact remains that the online
matrimonial sites are indeed cheaper, faster and more interactive. They
provide better conduits to the users for disseminating information. Its
updating option never allows the information shared by the users to
become obsolete. The searchers can get more detailed information about
the prospective partner.
<blockquote>
I got his request, saw the profile… Our families met and by the
end of our third meeting we did *roka*[^11_Dwivedi_32]… on 27th feb 2014.
Very happy to have found him.
</blockquote>

Another profile says:
<blockquote>
… … … Then the family interacted to each other to materialize things
and plan for the final day. In less than 2 months we got married.
</blockquote>

And the other says:
<blockquote>
At the first meeting itself we knew there was no looking around anymore
and decided to talk to our parents … … … even our *kundali's
**(horoscope) matched.
</blockquote>

Even with the online technology the customs and traditions remain
intact. Though the online matrimonial sites have transformed the
searching process yet arranging a match for oneself is no way a
self-arranged marriage. The role of family members or parents has not
been marginalized. The online searchers only find a partner for
themselves and they convince their parents about their selection. The
parents meet each other and they did ‘*roka’* (a promise) that they will
not search further. The interaction between family members has many
directions. It finds whether the family of prospective bride and groom
is religious, courteous, prosperous, good-looking, and healthy. The
“*kundali’* horoscope match is more important than love. It ensures the
mutual compatibility, future lifestyle, nature, behavior, preferences,
and the longevity of the relationship between the prospective bride and
groom.

Who is making a profile is again a socio-cultural decision. It is
generally considered indecent for a woman to create her own account.
Many times if the account indicates that it is opened by a woman
searching for a partner then men do not take that woman seriously and
consider her easy-going.[^11_Dwivedi_33] Mostly, the women’s accounts provide
information that they are created by friends, parents, and relatives
irrespective of the fact that they have created it. “*How can I indicate
that I have opened an account for myself… … … men will consider me
‘Chaalu’ (indecent)”* - replied a woman respondent.

A profile said:
<blockquote>
I am searching a partner for *my friend* Shruti… … …she is charming and
well-educated.
</blockquote>
And:
<blockquote>
My daughter Rama is a software Engineer. She is 27, and she works for
an MNC.</blockquote>

One woman stated in her desired partner profile: 
<blockquote>“Govt Job IAS IES IFS
IRS PCS ALL India”[^11_Dwivedi_34] and another wanted “preferably an NRI or from
All India Services - IAS/ IPS / Indian Foreign Service. UP MP Rajasthan
in India.”</blockquote>

Perceptions are changing in the Indian patriarchal society. Earlier
annulled, divorced, awaiting divorce, widowed, and single middle-aged
women were only taking an initiative to open an account and search for a
partner. Now young single women are also going online for a partner of a
specific profession, qualification, and location. Inter-state migration
and living away from the family have brought changes in their
perception. However, men’s profiles are largely created and posted by
them. They generally prefer beautiful, fair-complexioned and educated
wife, but in some cases they want a working wife to support the family.

### Abusers

Incidentally online matrimonial sites technology is not free from abuse.
Online Matrimonial Abusers (OMA) are of three types: blackmailers,
frauds, and maniacs.[^11_Dwivedi_35] They register an account for neither love nor
for marriage but only for abusing other users.

### Blackmailers, Frauds, and Maniacs

There are many fake accounts generated by the OMA on matrimonial sites.
The blackmailers and frauds work in a gang where they create many
profiles and their targets are emotionally weak, unworldly,
inexperienced, gullible people. Since the matrimonial sites are based on
the SDI (selective dissemination of information) technology, they trick
men and women of different ages, religion and profession by showing keen
interest in their profiles, and employing a wide range of false
projections.

Blackmailers work in three stages. First, they become the friend of a
targeted user. Then, they record a video and conversation with the user
(for example, on *Skype,* etc.). Finally, they threaten to expose and
make it public if the user does not provide money. Frauds, on the other
hand, use different tactics to get money, first, by showing interest and
becoming friendly, and then narrating a false story. For example, they
met with an accident, and need money, they were robbed in a strange city
so transfer money urgently, they have lost their wallet and they need to
pay the hotel bills in a new place, etc. The genuine users who have been
chatting and talking to these frauds and blackmailers for months
generally do not understand their tricks and may easily be trapped and
abused.

Maniacs are sexual perverts and nymphomaniacs.[^11_Dwivedi_36] They create an
account to seduce the genuine online users. They get pleasure by
talking, chatting, engaging and involving with someone without any
serious engagement. They abuse the technology and person for months and
then they shift to a different target.

## Conclusion

Online matrimonial sites are influencing the searching practices. The
partner seekers are recognizing it as a potential search engine for a
prospective partner. New relationships have been formed and sustained on
the basis of selective dissemination of information by the users and
service providers. These sites are converting the traditional concept of
“love after marriage” into a more rational concept of “first understand
each other then marriage.”

The so-called “obedience” of sons and daughters to marry a person whom
their parents’ select is now influenced and directed by the matrimonial
sites. These “grown-up” children are expressing their needs of a
prospective partner by creating an account on the matrimonial sites.
Even before their parents had realized the need of a partner for them,
they would have spent a considerable amount of time on deciding,
discussing and desiring for a partner.

The rigid societal norms for dating are weakening, and men and women are
meeting more frequently with each other without parental permission and
supervision. The socializing among opposite sex has increased, and
parents are allowing them to spend some time with each other before they
tie a knot for life. However, the maintenance of the order of the caste
and religion on these sites is possibly the most interesting factor
which describes the adaptation and appropriation of technology in a
socially complex institution. These sites have brought a change in the
searching process only but they have not made a social change in the
society. The tradition and cultural values pertaining to Indian
marriages in the society remain intact.

In traditional methods of searching a partner, the background of the
women and men and their families is cross-checked by the word of mouth
mostly accomplished by the parents or the relatives. But in online
arranged marriages the users initiate the search by focusing on the
background of the prospective partner only. Moreover, this online
process leads fast results and it opens many options at the same time.
Introduction to new technologies in searching a partner has been working
as a medium of pressure release for young adults. The virtually smart
communicators who shy away from making any type of physical
communication at an early stage of courtship period generally find
matrimonial sites beneficial and effective to initiate a search for a
partner.

These matrimonial sites are bridging the gap between the traditional
offline culture and modern online system of finding a partner. The
association of the two practices is complementing each other by
providing more varied options and results to their searches. The social
construction of technology in the Indian traditional set-up can be well
defined and understood by these sites. The interaction between the
matrimonial sites and the potential partner seekers is relatively
fruitful. This metaphor describes that the matrimonial sites have grown
popular among youths, and the partner-seekers have got the prospective
partners. There were only 5 cases noted out of 370 mixed samples where
the users of the matrimonial sites were not satisfied. Table 2
summarizes the differences between online and offline partner search
practices.

## Limitations

The research collected data from the states of northern India where
people spoke Hindi, or a dialect of Hindi, and understood English. There
are other 16 regional languages spoken in the various states of India
which were not included due to the limited exposure of the author with
the other states and considering the paucity of time for the research.

The spatio-temporal constraint obstructed the author to collect
face-to-face data from the other five states, including Delhi, Uttar
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab.

The data could not include the feedback from the users in term of: how
can the matrimonial sites make this overall experience more interactive
and beneficial? Similarly, it could not incorporate the feedback and
experiences of the respondents who had got a partner offline.

    bride became so friendly that they ended up in telephone-sex.
