**The Advertising and Profit Model of Leading Dating Sites in China: A
Comparison of Jianyuan, Baihe and Zhenai’s Targeting and Advertising**

**Caiyun Wen**

**The Prosperity and Bottlenecks of the Online Dating Market in China**

In China, matchmaking is an ancient occupation, which plays a key role
to the marriage mode in the traditional society. With the development of
the Internet in China, matchmaking is switching to the Internet model.
Chinese single users aged 18 and older are expected to reach 195 million
by 2015, according to iResearch.com.[^9_Wen-Final_1] The online dating market will
reach 1.9 billion yuan (about 304 million dollars),[^9_Wen-Final_2] with an average
annual compound growth rate at 31.3 percent. Because of new single users
and the changes from traditional media to the Internet, the dating sites
have a prosperous market. Founded in 2003, Jiayuan.com was listed in the
NASDAQ. On January 14, 2014, Jiayuan.com announced that the Internet
registers had reached 100 million.[^9_Wen-Final_3] In China, Jiayuan.com, Baihe.com
and Zhenai.com account for about 70 percent of all the dating site
business in terms of market share. By case studying these three sites,
this article silhouettes the development pattern of dating sites in
China.

Chinese dating sites began in the 1990s. In the first few years, because
the Internet was accessible to limited users and the cost was high, the
number of Internet users was only 8.9 million in 1998.[^9_Wen-Final_4] Dating sites
were developing slowly due to small scale and unsatisfying service
advantage. The short period from 2003 to 2005 saw the increased
penetration of the Internet among Chinese users and the burgeoning of
online dating sites, some being the copycat of foreign websites such as
Match.com. In the following years till 2012, Chinese online dating sites
changed from free to paid and explored new profit models. Since 2012,
online dating sites have been struggling with their bottlenecks.

Although the dating sites have sufficient potential customers, the
leading dating sites’ growth suddenly deteriorated for nearly two years.
The overall ceiling has begun in the dating sites. On December 24, 2012,
Haiyan Gong, founder of Jiayuan.com announced her resignation out of
operating pressure and occupation bottleneck. Fanjiang Tian, the CEO of
Baihe.com, said, the single users, accumulated over the past 10 years,
created a fast growth of members, but this growth would slow down with
the development of dating sites to a certain extent, and online charging
mode of 199-499 yuan,[^9_Wen-Final_5] per person per year was near to the maximum
which one could accept.[^9_Wen-Final_6]

At the same time, the competitive threats from the social networking
sites (SNSs)[^9_Wen-Final_7] also affected the stability of the dating sites’ user
group. For example, as a “real” social website like Facebook, Renren
provides a search function to find friends. If "single" is entered as
the filter, all the single users’ information will show up. This is a
great threat to the dating sites. More importantly, these SNSs have
greater users and the users are more fixed than dating websites. The
listing prospectus of Sina Weibo showed that the monthly active users
are 129 million.[^9_Wen-Final_8] Many people begin to use Renren from high school or
college, and will continue because this platform helps maintain the
network and offers functions such as games to make users adhesive.

In this case, to attract new users is the most effective means to the
dating sites. At present advertising produces the main income for
several Chinese leading dating sites. They increased advertising
efforts, expanded the advertising media (from the Internet to TV,
outdoor and printed media). According to statistics of Market Research
Center of CCTV, only from 2011 to June 2013, at the China Central
Television (CCTV), the advertising time of dating sites was 53,530
seconds, up to 3,573 pieces. The total cost was 146,588,100 yuan (about
23.46 million U.S. dollars).

At present, Jiayuan.com spends most money on online search advertising,
in which Baidu.com leads with tens of millions yuan,[^9_Wen-Final_9] in addition to
the portal websites,[^9_Wen-Final_10] the vertical websites[^9_Wen-Final_11] and navigation
websites.[^9_Wen-Final_12] The Spring Festival, or the Chinese New Year, is as
important to Chinese as Christmas to Christians. It is a time for family
reunion, togetherness, and leisure activities, and the best timing for
advertisers. Baihe.com spent 30 million yuan (about 4.8 million U.S.
dollars) only during the Spring Festival on buses, subway trains,
television and the Internet in 2011.[^9_Wen-Final_13] Zhenai.com also put a lot of
advertisement on television and outdoor billboards in recent years.

Although the leading dating sites all spend money on advertising, their
advertising aims, advertising media and the campaigns are different.
Baihe.com used television advertising to enhance brand awareness.
Jiayuan.com, the first advertiser on CCTV among dating sites, steered to
new media in 2011. In contrast Zhenai.com and Baihe.com frequently
advertise on CCTV.

**Jiayuan.com: the Multi-dimensional Strategy **

In the construction of the advertising model, Jiayuan.com adopted a
multi-dimensional strategy. These include, but are not limited to,
Internet marketing, topics marketing, and entertainment marketing.

***The Internet Media Marketing - Micro Film for the Single Youth***

In China, many young urban professionals are from the rural areas or
small cities. Because of their limited circle of communication and tight
work schedules, they have few chances to find their prospective
partners. But according to traditional Chinese beliefs, if a woman
remains single at 30, she is odd. Her parents will be very anxious about
this because parents take children’s marriage as their responsibility.
They will lose face in front of friends and relatives, especially during
the Spring Festival, a time for visiting each other. Although the single
group is under the psychological pressure from the family and the people
around, and they yearn for affection themselves, they still pursue their
own love, and don't want to lower mate-selection criteria. They are
young, faddish and patient. They desire for the real love instead of the
marriage form or sex.

This group is Jiayuan's target audience. The Internet marketing
strategies are as follows.

The micro film (*Wei Dianying*) is a small film, produced by
professional person, with movie narrative methods, played through the
Internet or other new media platform.[^9_Wen-Final_14] The micro film is no longer
than 30 minutes commonly. Now, the micro film is a popular form among
young people. It has the entertainment features of films and the
commercial essence of advertising, which weave the corporate brand goals
and business activities into a small story so that the advertising is
more acceptable than ordinary commercials. Jiayuan’s target audience is
aged 20 to 35, and they work alone in a strange city. These young people
are the major audience of the micro film. Therefore, the micro film was
the proper media in Jiayuan’s advertising strategy. Jiayuan.com launched
a series of micro films such as "*Waiting (2013) ","Fear (2013)", "Busy
(2013)"* and "*Dilemma (2013)". "Waiting*" is about a city girl. She was
waiting for an elevator, a bus, a dinner, a green light, a reply, a
courier, and her friends’ visits. She waited a lot, but most
importantly, for love. *"Fear"* features the same girl but more
determined. She insisted living independently in a strange city. In the
end, she knew although she could face the pressure from work, actually,
she had fear of loneliness in all forms. This film disclosed her
vulnerability under a strong appearance. The theme is no matter how
strong a girl is, she needs a partner. It shows a girl’s longing for a
family as affected by traditional Chinese values. *“Busy”* is about “*no
matter how busy one is, she has to stop and hunt for a personal
companionship”.* "*Dilemma"* features "*love is not what you possess,
but what you regard it as."*[^9_Wen-Final_15]

Ranging from the life details to the psychological concepts, this series
of micro film highlight the same theme of obstacles to love and
marriage. The advertisement is an inspiration from concept of living to
the idea of love for the urban wandering group *(Dushi Piaobozu)*. The
urban wandering group is very common in big cities in China.

They were born in rural areas, and settled down in the city after
college. They live in the city alone, far away from their families and
relatives. In China, a person working far away from hometown often
indicates that she has few friends and no house, both important to
marriage. As one of the most basic conditions for survival, the house is
usually ancestral property. When the children get married, the parents
will provide the house for them. Even now, few young people are willing
to live in a rented place after marriage.

By telling the stories in the advertisement, Jiayuan.com discovered the
love predicament of the urban wandering group, broke their vulnerable
psychological defense and moved them by love.

With the speed of the dissemination of information and the development
of recording equipment, many young people like taking pictures to record
and share their lives with others. In 2012, Jiayuan.com, cooperating
with Kugou.com,[^9_Wen-Final_16] launched "*My Time*" themed activities on the
Internet, encouraging users to create a postcard about the wonderful
moments in life and post it to the most beloved person. Users created,
downloaded and printed postcards, with a Jiayuan’s stamp, then sent them
to relatives and friends. This activity combined the Internet and the
traditional media, from online to offline, and received about 4.58
million hits. These activities added about 45,681 new users to Jiayuan.

***Topics Marketing - Hot Topics from TV Dramas***

Hot topics are of human interest. If these hot topics are capitalized on
in marketing, a very good marketing effect will be achieved.

In 2009, a TV drama *"A Beautiful Daughter-in-law Era"* (*Xifu De Meihao
Shidai*) was a hit. The hero, an ordinary guy, impressed many women with
his understanding, tolerance, diligence and honesty. The TV drama
returned to traditional values, which emphasize that understanding,
tolerance and mutual support are more important than a solemn pledge of
love in marriage. To love, one needs to express and take action. Thus,
Jiayuan.com launched a big discussion on mate-selection criteria about
*A Beautiful Daughter-in-law Era*. Although it took the conventional way
of advertising, such as music videos (MV), banners, clients, product
placement, many young people responded. Nearly 300,000 people
participated in 21 days, promoting registration and the awareness of
Jiayuan’s brand. This activity facilitated the exploration of the
significance of marriage in modern China where people feel baffled at
the great social change. Jiayuan.com achieved good advertising effects
by making use of hot issues.

***Entertainment Marketing - Joining Dating Reality Shows***

The fast-paced lifestyle and pressure force people to turn to
entertainment for relaxation. Entertainment marketing emerges as the
time requires. Many advertisers combine the brand image with different
entertainments so that effects can be achieved in an invisible but
effective way.

In China, male bachelors are generally referred to as *guanggun*,
literally "bare branches". Originally pejorative only to men, now it has
become a neutral word for both men and women, sometimes in a helpless
and joking tone. In China, the technology to identify the sex of a fetus
made the sex ratio unbalanced. “The sex ratio for children up through
age 4 is over 120:100 (120 boys for every 100 girls), according to the
2000 census. By comparison, a normal sex ratio for this age group is 105
or less.”[^9_Wen-Final_17] According to the 1 percent population sample survey data
in 2005, birth sex ratio even reached 128:100 in Hubei, a populous
province.[^9_Wen-Final_18] These partly result in more bare branches. November 11th
(11/11) of every year is celebrated as Singles Day in China because the
figure "1" looks like a lonely person ("bare branches"). And the day is
for people without partners.

Now Singles Day is used as one of the commodity promotion opportunity by
many businesses. It even turned into an online shopping day. On November
11, 2013, Taobao.com’s[^9_Wen-Final_19] sales amount reached 35 billion yuan (about
5.6 billion U.S. dollars). On November 11, 2011, Jiayuan.com launched
the "Bare Branches Revolution"[^9_Wen-Final_20] (*Guanggun Da Geming*) campaign, in
which they called for single men and women to try to find their
significant other, and make self-made marriage certificate in online
games. This activity was again in cooperation with Kugou.com and had the
significant effect: 2.49 billion users displayed the information on the
Kugou.com platform with 32.61 million hits, users made 1.76 million
marriage certificates and 323,246 new users registered at
Jiayuan.com.[^9_Wen-Final_21]

In addition, with the increasing popularity of dating reality show in
China, Jiayuan.com used product placement in the hottest television
dating program *“Romance in Car” (Langman Manche)*. It is imported and
adapted from the British online dating reality show *“Date My Car”*. The
program combines cars with human personalities by integrating global
success into local culture. In the program, the guests guess the
master’s character through his or her automobile brand, appearance and
the interior of the car. In the program four male guests compete with
each other, until only one is left. The competition gained high
popularity in the audience. Later, the program changed to four female
guests and one male, but also achieved good results. In the program,
Jiayuan’s brand occupied the main position all the time. Because
Jiayuan’s theme was accordant with the dating program, so brand
implanting achieved good results. The search about Jiayuan.com was as
high as 12,000 on Baidu.com one quarter, grew by about 137 times than
the previous quarter.[^9_Wen-Final_22]

Compared with Jiayuan’s diversified marketing strategies, several other
dating sites were unwilling to lag behind.

**Baihe.com: the Model of Chinese Culture**

Baihe.com stands out with its unique name and advertising model. "Baihe"
is the homonym of a flower, lily, symbolizing nobility and purity in
Chinese culture, and *bai nian hao he,* a wish for a hundred-year-long
harmonious marriage. This name of the website shows the characteristics
of Chinese culture - marriage connotating more responsibilities and
obligations than love. In addition, because Chinese tend to constrain
their emotions rather than speaking out, many Chinese couples never say
“I love you” to their significant other until death. Chinese pay more
attention to the length and continuity of marriage. *Bai nian hao he*
conveys the best wishes.

The series of Baihe’s campaigns also featured such consistent thoughts.
In "*Father and Daughter* ", an old father was worried about the
daughter’s marriage, but he lacked Internet literacy. So he asked
neighbors to register on Baihe.com for his daughter. This advertisement
reflects the traditional culture in which parents are one of the main
driving forces of marriage. Because the theme is full of tender
feelings, the advertisement tends to be more acceptable than the
mandatory. In addition, highlighting advantages of a real-name
registration system gives customers a sense of security. In another
advertisement themed "*House*", a young man made a serious proposal in
front of the girl’s parents because he had purchased a house for their
wedding. In "*Pay Card*", a young man sent his pay card to a girl and
the girl was touched. This series of advertisements reflect the
courtship with Chinese characteristics, marriage in the life of the
parents, housing guarantee and the financial power of women. Another
long advertisement was full of interviews of ordinary people about the
different understanding of love, the heartbeat-scene description, the
expectations to marriage partner, and the interpretation of marriage.
These remarks were appealing to the people who had no more illusions
about love, but only want to live steadfastly.

Baihe’s advertisements are more traditional and populist, lack of
fashion and fantasy. This is consistent with the traditional belief of
love in the Chinese culture: love does not need a solemn pledge of
affection and romance, but shared duties and mutual understanding of the
couple. The husband and the wife live together through life. In the same
vein, the male in the advertising is neither sleek nor romantic. He is
pragmatic and down-to-earth, only preparing the money and the house for
the marriage. On the other hand, the advertisements also reflect that
the consumerism culture has a profound influence to modern Chinese
marriage. Many single women lay emphasis on the materials men can
provide rather than emotional elements. In addition, parents showed up
in these ads, common in Chinese culture. Because Chinese pay more
attention to the interpersonal relationship network, so the marriage is
not only for two individuals, but two families. Family members,
especially parents, have a big impact on marriage.

Even in the micro film advertising "*One Day of an IT Grassroot
Man*"[^9_Wen-Final_23] (*IT Diaosinan De Yitian*), a young man who was a typical
ordinary single IT male lived his life like this: traditional,
black-frame glasses, backpack, headset always in the ears, never
changing shirts, mobile phone always in hand, getting up in the dream
hastily, having breakfast on the way, subway... IT men are considered as
social elites according to the income in China. But due to their heavy
work schedules, they account for a large percentage of bachelors in
large cities. Mu Yan, founder and vice president of Baihe, said, “I am a
pure IT man. IT man is a special group.”[^9_Wen-Final_24] Of course, the stereotype
of young men who work in the information technology industry is
dangerous, not all IT men are in accordance with this image. Although
the man in the ad resonates with some IT peers, it may impose a wrong
impression of IT man on the audience.

Consistent with the above style, the advertising features numbers for
the reasons why IT men were single:

-   50.1% of IT man think "The IT circle is too small"

-   There are 41. 8% of IT man think "the other half’s requirements is
    too high"

-   21.3% of IT man think that "IT is busy"

-   According to the survey: IT man lives as follows

-   The average sleep time is 5.6 hours every day

-   The average working time is 12.8 hours every day

-   The annual average time of “blind date” is only 3.5 times[^9_Wen-Final_25]

This disciplined mindset and down-to-earth style may make the target
audiences of Baihe.com more focused. To help resonate with such an
audience, Baihe.com chose Honglei Sun, an ordinary-looking actor who
gained popularity by playing brilliant, honest, and responsible
characters, as its spokesman. Sun has played tough guys and reliable
husbands in films and television dramas. To the single young people who
want to find a partner to go through ups and downs, the image is very
suitable. In general, Baihe’s slogan – Love Seriously, advertising style
and the target groups are more consistent.

However, not all of Baihe’s commercials are successful. In another
campaign, "*Through the Night*"[^9_Wen-Final_26] *(Zou Yelu)*, a single female
college student walked alone in a dark corridor. Then a ghost who
covered her face with long hairs is here and there behind her back with
horror music on. When the girl went to the washroom, the ghost came.
When the ghost traced the hair covering the face, the audience saw that
the ghost was a girl without a comb. This advertisement is neither
appealing nor meaningful. It kicks up a cloud of dust. Obviously, it
ruined the consistency and the cultural connotation of Baihe.com. In a
word, it is a meaningless advertisement.

**Zhenai.com: From Romance to Consumerism**

Founded in 1998, Zhenai.com is another leader offering online dating
services, which was named "*Best Chinese Dating Website 2010*" by China
Internet Weekly.[^9_Wen-Final_27] Zhenai’s target audience is white-collars between
25 to 45 years old. To be received by target groups, Zhenai.com
collaborates with nationally well-known television dating shows, such as
*"You Are the One (Fei Cheng Wu Rao)", "Only One in a Hundred Is Chosen
(Bai Li Tiao Yi)",*[^9_Wen-Final_28] *"Try Connecting Love (Ai Qing Lian Lian
Kan)".*[^9_Wen-Final_29] Because some users use false information to cheat online,
single young users are doubtful to online information. Zhenai.com used
the matchmaker offline as a countermeasure. In the mean time, the
registers’ information needs to be verified by the Ministry of Public
Security. In this way, Zhenai.com gained the fame of seriousness and
discretion.

In the first several years, Zhenai’s advertisements featured romance and
warmth, offering attractiveness to the single white-collar. It ran its
advertisements on TV and outdoor media such as subway stations and
trains. However, in recent years, shifts were seen in the theme of
Zhenai’s advertisements such as "*Gold Digger" (Bai Jin Nu Pian), "For
Only Love" (Zhi Ai Lang Man Nu Pian), "Appearance Association" (Wai Mao
Xie Hui Pian),*[^9_Wen-Final_30] which caused controversy. Zhenai.com changed its
target audience from company white-collars to looks ordinary earners.
The advertisements are the modern use of ridicule, from a few extremes
to one common theme: no matter what values the registered user is
looking for, she can find a suitable partner at Zhenai.com.

In the "*Gold Digger* ", an ordinary-looking girl with a Northeastern
accent found her spouse. She said, "You are ugly and knock gritty. Never
mind. You are twenty or thirty years old, even you are in your seventies
or eighties. Never mind. As long as you have money, I will marry you."
Then she mentioned the large house and the luxury car are also
important. In "*For Only Love "*, a girl put forward, "Do not care about
height or weight. Do not care about his looking. Do not care about his
figure. Forget the family and schooling. Only if you are romantic, that
will do." In the "*Appearance Association*", a girl presented another
view, "A suitable man should be tall and slim with a handsome face. He’d
better be as good-looking as an actor. Even if you are autistic,
womanish, or promiscuous in sex relations, I love you as long as you
have a pretty face."

Mate-selection criteria were externalized and materialized so the
advertisements were criticized. Although the advertisements ridicule
some people and exactly reflect their criteria, these criteria are
external which do not comply with the traditional Chinese values and
violated the basic human values focusing on inherent qualities. Both
Baihe and Zhenai’s advertisements were about the external qualities of
love and marriage, but Baihe.com highlighted responsibility and
sincerity in marriage, while Zhenai.com emanated superficiality and
irresponsibility for love. For thousands of years, Chinese always attach
more importance to inner beauty than the external. Chinese men are
supposed to be responsible and diligent, Chinese women warm-hearted and
down-to-earth. If one focuses on appearance, he or she will be
considered wanton. Self-cultivation is the main way to enhance oneself.

In this series of campaigns, the unabashed money worship, advocating of
one’s physical appearance and the so-called romance contribute to a
Zhenai that only values materialism, at least to some users. Although
consumerism is prevalent in China, the lack of cultural connotation and
a standard of value accepted by Chinese consumers does not bring good
reputation to the site. Zhenai’s transformation is not successful.

**Problems and Suggestions**

Although the above leading dating sites of China used different
advertising models to build their brand image and increase the number of
registered members, their advertising models have common problems and
affected their development.

One of the most important problems is that the advertising model lacks
in-depth cultural values. The current marriage websites make
externalized marriage matching criteria, such as Jiayuan’s "dream lover"
that was overly materialistic and superficial. Zhenai.com also
highlighted the pursuit of money and appearance in their advertisement.
In the advertisements, romance was not the form of love but the standard
for the young to select their partners.

The materialistic and external standard above is against the traditional
marriage concept in China, traditional values and common human values.
On the other hand, it is also the consumerism society's material
extrusion on people. With the development of economy, a materialistic
consumerism trend sweeps Chinese. The consumerism consciousness is
strong. Marriage is no exception. Lisa Rofel argues that the “desiring
subjects” is at the core of China’s contingent.[^9_Wen-Final_31] With the spread of
public culture, materialism has insinuated into every field. Materialism
has encroached upon and eroded people's spiritual life, including the
pursuit of love and romance. Affected by consumerism, mate-selection
criteria have changed from focusing on the internal to external, from
the spirit to substance.

Of course, Baihe.com tried to change the external standards. It used a
personality assessment system, which matched the register users’
character with psychological characteristics and personality. Although
there are some improvements, it needs highly specialized personnel for
testing and evaluating results because the psychological test is
professional. Current employees of the dating sites in China don’t meet
such standards. So the match can produce limited effects.

The harmonious marriage is the fit of intrinsic values, and the
involvement of emotional experiences. How to evaluate the deep values
and make the customers feel the emotional experience is the most
important challenge the dating sites are facing. The author believes
that emotional experience is the main demand of dating website
advertising. To do this, in-depth mining of the Eastern marriage values
in advertising can be further explored. China is known for its
high-context culture. Chinese are family-oriented and committed to a
lifelong and continuous marriage and tolerance. Such values would be the
guidelines for advertising. This way, the inner psychological experience
of users and the information campaigns convey will resonate.

In addition, the profit model of dating sites not only relies on the
advertising model, but strengthens the function of dating websites. At
present, the main problem of Chinese dating sites is that the user
viscosity is not enough and the users are not willing to pay for
services on the website.[^9_Wen-Final_32] The key to these problems lies in the
dating sites’ service mode. If users can get high-quality services on
the dating website, they will want to stay on the site and be willing to
pay.

Although Jiayuan.com invested 20 million yuan (about 3.24 million U.S.
dollars) on establishing the Magpies site, which provides one-stop
service of marriage for just successful partners, a good start, on the
whole it was incomplete. The author thinks the dating sites should offer
a series of long-term service besides dating. They can provide the real
information and advice services according to the different courtship
stages, such as wedding planning, marriage program, parental advisory
services and children's education. When customers have various emotional
problems in love, want to get married, on the way to the altar, or have
child-rearing problems, they will get professional advice and consulting
services. So, won’t he want to revisit the website? Won’t he like to pay
for the valuable customized service? If the dating sites do not have
these services, they can cooperate with corresponding portal websites
and traditional media to capitalize on each other's resources.

At present, 6 to 12 months is the longest retention time for the
customers of dating sites. Once customers find the prospective partner,
they will immediately leave the dating site.[^9_Wen-Final_33] Therefore, the
advertisers on the banner ads on a dating website will consider the
long-term effects of advertising and may not want to advertise. Once the
customer viscosity increases and membership information needs are met
through the fee, profitability of website will also be greatly improved.
Website banner ads also will increase profits. This would be a virtuous
cycle.
