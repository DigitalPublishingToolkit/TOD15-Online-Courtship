# Liberalism Conquering Love: Reports and Reflections on Mass Romantic and Sexual Consumption in the Internet Age

### Pascal Lardellier

## Introduction

The Internet and dating websites have had a strong impact on the nature
of seductive relationships over a short period of time. This statement,
which is not strictly deterministic, is based on a series of
observations. Over the last 15 years or so, new means of meeting,
flirting and falling in love have appeared -- all behind multiple
screens. The traditional methods and timescale of seduction have been
turned upside down. On the Internet you become acquainted with others
from the inside out and many fall in love with these ‘strangers.’ In
1999, the movie *You’ve Got a Message* very explicitly put a story and
images to this new phenomenon.

In 2012, the American actor-director John Malkovich pitched a
contemporary production of the famous novel of Choderlos de Laclos,
*Liaisons dangereuses*, in Paris. Malkovich, who in 1989 played the
Vicomte de Valmont for producer Stephan Frears, has adapted this classic
piece to the Internet generation. In this production, social networks
(Facebook, Twitter), smartphones, and texting all play important roles.
It is always interesting to observe the impact of different technical
interfaces on the way we fall in love. Each historical period brings its
own combination of its values and approaches to love. Malkovich’s
Parisian adaptation shows that the role of the written word in seduction
and relationships is reinforced through the use of the Internet. Of
course, as in the ‘classic’ age of love, we still find cynicism,
hypocrisy, lies, and manipulation. But now, they are all technologically
assisted.

It is a new state of mind and an unprecedented ideology that now
presides over computer-assisted romantic-sexual relationships. Single
people online commodify themselves in what we can call “romance
marketing”.

This chapter will begin by analyzing the manner in which liberalism has
established itself as the dominant new ideology of postmodern
romantic/seductive relationships. Liberalism is implicitly present in
the discourse of those on the Internet as much as it is in their online
habits. This observation is based on surveys conducted on the subject by
the author, in the French-speaking world, over the past ten years. The
chapter will then discuss this phenomenon in the light of more general
sociological reflections and philosophical considerations about love and
the digital-network-era couple.

## Methodology and Surveys

This chapter is based on two surveys carried out between 2003 and 2012,
then published in 2004 and 2012.[^8_Lardellier_1] In order to conduct these surveys,
we partnered with four heterosexual dating websites, gathering data from
both French nationals and other French-speaking people. 260 (130 from
each group) questionnaires were gathered and processed along with 30
interviews. The title of this chapter, “Liberalism Conquering Love,” was
a theme mentioned by the majority of those surveyed, despite some
differences in wording. The analyses taken from these surveys were
developed by the author, who has experience working in this field.

## The Victory of Liberalism in Romantic Relationships

First of all, it should be remembered that romantic/seductive
relationships on the Internet have notable differences from those in
real life. Online, you do not see who you are speaking to, and you do
not know him or her because he or she is hidden behind a pseudonym and a
screen. Likewise, things often move faster than in real life, where the
temporality of seduction is often rather slow. In recent years, many
authors have noted that digitized relationships are becoming subject to
liberalism[^8_Lardellier_2] considered both as an economic doctrine and as a
collection of values and ideology. They see relationships in the
Internet age as commodities, governed by the principles of
utilitarianism. To say that this economic theory is gaining the domain
of human relationships is more than just a metaphor. If we take certain
expressions literally, they can be incidentally revealing. On the
subject of dating websites, the Internet users interviewed spontaneously
alluded to: a “shopping for love,” a “supermarket,” “business and
commerce,” “unrestrained sexual consumption,” and a “store front window
for singles.” There are many who said that they choose a partner “like
you would pick a yogurt, or any product, shopping cart in hand.” In
short, “people have the impression of becoming merchandise” once they
sign up for a dating website. Some, disappointed by these sites, even
mention prostitution, “since you pay to have relationships with a
stranger”…. These lexical clichés from the users themselves are all
inspired by their experiences on existing dating websites.

Romantic encounters have thus become a market selling singles the
possibility of quick sexual relationships, as much as the hopes of a
life together. Online service providers, helped by marketing
specialists, were quick to seize this opportunity, appealing to the
dreams and wishes of individuals and evolving social norms.

On digital networks and dating sites, you label others using social
intuition before your first encounter. This leads to homophilia (being
attracted to people similar to us) and endogamy (couples forming on the
basis of existing social groups, values, and similar religions). In
fact, we see strong evidence of sociocultural kinship, an important
organizing principle in the matrimonial market and thus in the make-up
of couples. This makes it seem all the more shocking that online, we
always begin talking to others anonymously. Is love not as blind as we
all thought?

Several phases can be seen to have characterized the French market of
romantic encounters. After the first era of general dating websites, the
market appeared to have split. It began to offer websites based on
certain criteria such as ethnicity, religion, sociocultural status, and
socioeconomic background.

Likewise, on the Internet, relationships are liberalized. We see all
major principles of economic markets: an abundance of offers,
rationalization of the search for love, selective targeting, the ability
to choose from many offers, and the standardization of ‘products.’
Indeed, we faithfully fill out anthropometric forms while strictly
conforming to the sections given: a process of generalized
objectification or commoditization. The immensity of the offer –
hundreds of thousands of profiles[^8_Lardellier_3] – underlines this commoditization,
with the personal information of those registered being analyzed like
products for which we would read a factsheet. We can ‘test’ and change
whatever we find to be unsatisfactory or flawed.

Through all of the texts and images exchanged amongst strangers on
dating websites, we see that liberalism has invaded the sphere of human
relations. You must be efficient, attractive, and noteworthy to rise
above the crowd. You must always ‘perform’ well, with pictures that
broadcast the message that you want to be received. Romantic
relationships must yield productivity, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. The personal information pages put online must be
sales-worthy and impactful in order to be noticed. These adjectives are
a matter of marketing and coaching, which influence each type of
intimate relationship. On dating sites, everyone conforms to the
principles of romance marketing, considering themselves as exclusive
products to promote, or one product in competition with thousands of
others. In fact, on dating sites (like on social networks), many also
indulge in personal branding, both consciously and subconsciously. In
other words, they become their own brand. Once again, this is a notion
and concept which takes us into the commercial domain.

There is a famous French play by Pierre Marivaux, 1688-1768, entitled
“The Game of Love and Chance.”[^8_Lardellier_4] Today, on dating sites, we can speak
of “the game of love and the market.” As automated romantic
relationships imply output and profitability, each member of a site
becomes his or her own matrimonial cyber agent. In the era of the
triumph of marketing and liberalism, we are under the impression that
feelings can be reduced to consumer advantages, emotional capital, and
successful interviews. In a similar vein, this is symbolized by
speed-dating: a trend in which the first contact strangely resembles a
job interview.

Then there is the recent appearance of love coaching. Love coaches are
in charge of singles as if they were relegated beings who must be
motivated in order to even think of landing a good catch. The goal of
these relationship coaches is to increase the value of your capital,
display your qualities, and make good use of your potential. These
principles and practices are a part of managerial ideology and fall
within this current liberal framing of romantic/seductive relationships.

Even though these digital networks are filled with cynicism, there is
some romanticism and sincerity. But the majority of people registered on
dating sites are after quick consumption, rather than searching for
long-term relationships, According to the statements of members, men
tend to be more pressing, eager to receive a number, an instant
messenger name, or a Skype screen name, then a real-life meeting, as
early as possible, to build up the relationship. That is to say, to move
to a sexual relationship.

Many works, whether novels or essays, written in recent years by men who
frequent dating sites confirm the idea that picking up partners is like
an industrialized process. In 2005, the Frenchman Lewis Wingrove
explained in his work on *Of Mice and Men* how much rationalization,[^8_Lardellier_5]
assisted by IT tools, can favor optimal output in the seduction process.
But there are not only winners in this game of love and the market. In
his novel, *Extension du domaine de la lutte* (*Broadening the Field of
Struggle)*, the famous French novelist Michel Houellbecq, from 1994 to
the present, predicted the entrance of sexuality into the era of liberal
competition, with winners and, of course, losers. In this work, he puts
forth frustrated, unlikeable, pathetic anti-heroes who are tortured by
insatiable urges that make them suffer. The handsome ones and those full
of themselves easily obtain sexual fulfillment. As for the losers, they
are left with pictures, fantasies, and masturbation as their solace.

### Dating Websites: a Triple Principle of Economics

Romantic/seductive online relationships are governed by a triple
principle of economics: the economics of time, money, and emotions. This
concept assures their success. Once registered, which only takes a few
minutes, you have access to a vast pool of singles -- thousands of
people who virtually interest you and who can potentially be interested
in your new profile.

The economics of money, likewise, puts you in contact with all of these
people which would have been much more onerous (offering dates, etc.) in
‘real life.’ Accepting an offer from a letter that was copied and pasted
and sent to dozens of people is a common practice that alludes to
Taylorism -- since it is a question of rationalizing a task.

Lastly, we see economics of emotion on these sites, because losing face
and its cost are opportunely ousted by the absence of the other. Making
a digital exit does not cost anything in terms of face. However, there
is fierceness in competition that is not specific to the virtual world
and that can cause what psychoanalysts call a narcissistic injury: the
feeling you are left with after an emotionally-invested relationship is
terminated. But the Internet allows you to “move on to the next one.”

It is the overall system of dating sites which causes this consumption
trend. You make the most rational and judicious choice, generate traffic
around your page to become the focal product, and gather contact
information. That is the logic behind mass sexual and emotional
consumption. Certain members of dating sites even boast about their
sexual adventures as if they had collected exotic items or butterflies.
For them, thanks to dating sites, picking up partners has truly moved
from a small-scale hobby to an industry. Dating sites sanction marriage,
sexual and emotional consumption as well as marketing techniques.
Clearly, our era rationalizes emotional economics. We may still talk
about the heart, but it is often hard to distinguish the heart (*coeur)*
and the heart of our target (*coeur de cible*), which is of course a
marketing term.

One site that symbolizes this commoditization of online
romantic/seductive encounters is the French site *AdopteUnMec.com*
[adopt a guy]. With its overt and tongue-in-cheek feminist stance, this
site allows women to walk around with a shopping cart, browsing the
aisles of a virtual man-market. It is as if these men are special
products that you cannot miss, the deal of the day! In this realm, men
have few rights; they must obey – and only obey. The site is livened up
by a commercial metaphor in which the all-powerful female user does her
‘shopping’ with an online list that she drew up based on her criteria.
This site demands a good sense of humor, but it has had a lot of success
with its young clientele, who master the relationship codes on social
networks. So even if the title may seem exaggerated, we are most
certainly living in the realm of love won over by liberalism.

### The Internet, Romance, and Being Internationally Single

Liberalism is expressed in an even more tangible manner when you think
of online romantic/seductive encounters. The global expansion of dating
sites allows us to detect, more largely, the rise of a new international
singles market. Thus, tens of thousands of women living in developing
countries or zones of political unrest are trying to emigrate to ‘rich’
countries, thanks to the dating website network. This matrimonial
cyber-migration has opened a new type of migratory trend, lining the
pockets of cyber-café owners. In a documentary titled “Nord-Sud.com”
(North-South.com), the Frenchmen François Ducat explains that in 1997,
there were four cyber cafés in Yaoundé, Cameroon, and 450 in 2007. [^8_Lardellier_6]

There are only two logistical demands for cyber-cafés: computers must be
in individual booths and above all, equipped with webcams, since the
Western men chatting with these women and want to judge them on their
appearance. The competition is fierce and only the most attractive will
be noticed. These women must simultaneously be pretty, docile, sensual,
sweet, and offer hope for a meeting in Europe or North America. This
international single life sees hordes of women from Africa, Asia, and
ex-communist countries attempt to (and occasionally manage to) create a
‘cyber-union.’ Of course, one consequence is being uprooted from family
and cultural lifestyle. These women will attempt to live a new life, far
from home, (usually) with a white stranger who is wealthy and older then
themselves. These men buy the ‘youth’ of these women in exchange for
goods and a ‘better life.’ The success of these relationships varies.
Some adapt to Western ways, while others are depressed, yet make
sacrifices to stay. Then there are those who return to their country
after seeing that it would be impossible to become integrated. Finally,
many return after being disappointed or disillusioned by their Western
‘Prince Charming’.

There is economical asymmetry in these relationships that stretches
beyond the explanations of the protagonists. The men exhibit the
‘privileged values’ that these women look for in their future husband –
a level of income and lifestyle unavailable in their countries of
origin. Yet, these marital exiles also see native families torn apart
for the reward of others living in the European/American Eldorado.’

If this phenomenon makes searching for love an international affair, a
part of the intercultural melting pot, tearing apart destinies but also
bringing happiness to the lucky few, if it is amplified it could also
cause legitimate instability in the domestic marriage markets, and
heighten cultural and economic differences. “In the long term,
globalization of the dating market could have notable results. Western
women already have a difficult time finding men who fulfill their
expectations. As for Western men, even though they are seduced by
dynamic women, some may prefer a woman who is not too demanding to
ensure calm on the home front and thus […] turn towards the
international market to buy submission, youth, and beauty, ignoring the
independent, degree-bearing women in their country. […] However, the
poor men in the West are still having a difficult time finding
spouses.”[^8_Lardellier_7] The global singles market was created by dating sites and
founded on economic principles. Feelings are not completely absent, but
if they develop, it is much later on. ‘Playing the love market’ looks
set to remain a global game.

## Love on the Internet

This part of the chapter will expand the frame of analysis so as to
offer more general sociological and philosophical considerations about
the new types of couples found in the Internet era.

### Singles Enduring Paradoxical Tensions

First of all, it seems that the effects of solitude felt in our society
throughout history are still just as present in the era of commoditized
online relationships that made communication a social virtue. Users of
dating sites come across digital heartthrobs and virtual kisses.
Hundreds of people visit their personal page without meeting them
offline, an act, which can lead to lasting relationships -- sometimes,
of course, but not always.

Oftentimes, many of these singles feel high levels of stress on a daily
basis: exposing themselves to rejection, hoping for success,
symbolically risking everything, while at the same time giving
themselves the means to make a couple, in obedience to the constant
implicit social pressure from their entourage. If our era values those
who communicate well and know how to assert themselves in relationships,
then it has never been more difficult to meet others. If proof were
needed, we need simply to look at the millions who have already
registered for dating sites.

### The Traditional Couple Transformed by Information and Communication Technologies

In all cases, Internet suitors conform to a procedure which, for the
first time ever, reverses the chronology of events: they become
acquainted with one another before meeting, thus discovering each other
from the inside out. When they meet, they sleep together very quickly if
the ‘feeling’ is there. After that, love comes (or not). We understand
that this Copernican change in courting takes people away from their
traditional points of reference. They have to invent a new relationship
code, an unprecedented feat in the history of humanity as well as that
of romantic relationships.

The Internet offers a solution for finding your soulmate, but on
condition that you can escape being caught in the fringe. You frequently
move to the other side of the screen. Remember that in Ovid’s
*Metamorphosis,* Pygmalion commits himself to a virtual relationship
(even then!), with his beautiful statue, Galatea. From one illusion to
another, Narcissus prefers himself over even the tender love of the muse
Echo, until his self-admiration becomes his own death. And how many are
there on the Internet who put on this performance and who gaze at the
raving comments and gratification of others? “A relationship put in the
public eye via the Internet can allow someone to be satisfied with more
or less success than the profound human need of having relationships and
simultaneously promoting, in his or her own mind, a paranoid withdrawal,
thus avoiding all forms of intersubjective commitment.”[^8_Lardellier_8] This is true
because the web is all-powerful and allows you to fight against
anxieties and frustrations. An Internet connection can be compared to an
umbilical cord; it nourishes, calms, and relies on reassurance. New
technologies, in a broad sense, have become the preferred source of
pleasure for people from 25-49, even before sex.[^8_Lardellier_9]

We still love ‘for real’ in 2014, even if there is the temptation to be
all powerful – or, hide behind a screen. We still continue to meet
people in real life, experience physical attraction, and develop love
affairs in real life. More and more, however, we use information and
communication technologies and their resources in the courting process.
Significantly over half of romantic encounters among thirty-year-olds
are arranged by websites.

The model of the traditional couple is called into question by
information and communication technologies. Clearly, the Internet
‘produces’ a good amount of couples. But, as a consequence, it also
produces ‘defeats,’ as digital suitors reconnect for digital adultery,
polygamy and ‘sexfriending.’ These sites have given birth to a type of
recreational sexuality. In a parallel manner, the sentimentality
produced by these digital networks is fun and disengaged, but also
cynical – and occasionally hurtful in this regard. Our current era is
one of mass sexual and romantic consumption. We take, we make the most
of things, we enjoy those things, and we throw those things away. Of
course, we must not forget the numerous beautiful love stories which
also have their origin the Internet. However, those involved in these
stories often encountered disappointment and suffering before finally
finding a soulmate. This is due to the prevailing cynicism and the
unpleasant impression of being referred to like a supermarket product,
as others flip through a thick catalog full of people to be ‘consumed.’

We do not look at it all in a moral sense: there is not only frustration
or disgust in romantic and sexual consumption being industrialized by
the Internet. There are many who take great pleasure in the Internet and
use it for adventures and sexual experimentation. They live in ‘sensual
parentheses,’ filled with pleasure in order to break away from the
monotony of life. Since you can seduce or be seduced online, and almost
nobody shows it, casualness and immediate pleasure are the driving
forces of the system. But just because something exists for a short
amount of time, it does not mean that it will exist forever. After
experimenting with the first option of dating sites, sex, many users set
their hearts on the second promise: to find ‘true love.’

But even in this case, it becomes complicated, since the Internet
creates stress but also reassures. Matchmaking technology has
effectively opened an era of interchangeable options for romance. Not
one, not ten, but hundreds or even thousands have found their
significant others, virtually, thanks to digital networks. How many are
there, additionally, who brag and count their dozens of simultaneous
affairs and hundreds of ‘one night stands’? “If the abundance of
possibilities can be reassuring, it can also take on the form of an
indefinite, never-ending quest. You are compulsively drawn back to the
Internet, in a kind of stressful addiction. That is to say that you
embark upon a quest which is not only continuous, but one in which what
you do not always know what you are searching for.”[^8_Lardellier_10]

### Romantic Relationships – Fragile but Interchangeable

Nowadays, love is a fixed-term contract. But couples who have signed a
permanent contract can also fall apart due to the arrival of information
and communication technologies. These technologies could, at any moment,
bring about unsettling news, requests, or make you want to discretely
have a look around the Internet. We have never previously had to see our
exes and teen romances again as much as now, in an era where we can find
them three clicks and a few seconds later.

The Internet has introduced a sovereign restlessness to couples, most
notably in couples who met online. A little flaw in your partner? A bug,
an argument? Hit a rough spot? Well, there is now the enormous
temptation to reconnect so as to restart the search for virtual
candidates who will be less of a nuisance. But it is an illusion that
brings the imaginary into contact with reality. We can call it
“Bovaryism,” after Emma Bovary, heroine of 19^th^ century French
novellist Gustave Flaubert, who created a utopian life based on the
power of imagination.

However, we must not expect old examples to apply today. The famous
Marcel Proust, in his novel *Albertine disparue*, exemplifies this idea:
“this unique woman, we know that she would not have been for us if we
had been in another city when we met, if we had walked in another
neighborhood, if we had gone to another salon. Do we really think that
she is unique? She is just one of countless many”…and how many are there
on the Internet, sending notifications to others about going out for a
coffee, a drink, or going on a date, and never seeing this person again?
On the Internet, many romances end every day before even starting.
Singles who try to pick up others online know this after having come
across many people with whom a nice love story would have been possible.
Multiply this by millions, and this sensation contributes to making the
generation of Internet lovers nostalgic, yet disillusioned in facing the
brutality of technologically advanced and liberalized relationships.
They face so many failures, and do this all while confronting the
fragility of connections and the difficulty of creating a strong couple
in this society of ‘connected individualism.’

### Computer-Assisted Romance

It is always interesting to come back to the wisdom of ancient authors
in a period of change. From Ovid’s *The Art of Love*, a straightforward
manual on how to pick up others, to Plato’s *Symposium* and its origin
in tight-bonded relationships and hesitant love -- choosing one shortly
after the other, even if they were not necessarily accepted in their
eras. The Internet and dating sites have allowed us to opt for the
sentimental-sexual model of interchangeability and ‘getting around,’ but
only for a certain time. Despite the cynics and those who’ve been
disappointed, a lot of singles on the Internet are convinced that a
special person is hidden just behind a screen and that they will finally
be in contact, like the androgynous couples of Plato. We finally see
that the liberal ideology that we find on dating sites is
counter-balanced by a romantic ideology that has always exerted its
influence.

In 2014, those searching for love try to catch Venus or Cupid, the
mythical gods of desire and love, thanks to technology. And indeed, they
occasionally offer love to those who are constantly looking for it.
Then, it is left to the Internet lovers to learn how to work together
until they become a real couple. Thus, the most difficult part begins.
The Internet, which allows us to quickly create a bond with others, can
even more abruptly break this same bond. And so we see the history of
romantic relationships: never ending, always reinvented, continuing to
write itself.
