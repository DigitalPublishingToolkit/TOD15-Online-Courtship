Abstract: Computer mediated interpersonal interactions are defining our daily lives as we know it. Studying this phenomenon with various methodologies, across different cultures and traditions is a crucial component in understanding social ties. This book brings together articles that approach online dating from a  range of cultural and critical perspectives. 
The research decodes the approach to online dating in various countries like France, India, China, Turkey, Cuba, USA and Portugal. Mapping the history of dating and courtship shows the evolution of these practices even before the introduction of the online medium and traces parallels and differences between old and new traditions.

# What Are the *Shengnv* Looking for in Online Heterosexual Dating and Courtship? A Content Analysis of Shanghainese Women’s Personal Profiles on Jiayuan.com

### Tao Fu

## Introduction

Online dating is the romance-seeking process “in which individuals
create profiles and initiate contact with others through an online
service.”[^14_Fu_1] First appearing in the mid-1990s, online dating sites
enable users to create personal profiles and find matches according to
various criteria[^14_Fu_2] with the help of the computer-mediated
communication (CMC). Some sites are categorized as the match-making type
that help users search for the person with whom they may tie the
knot[^14_Fu_3] using complicated algorithms for pairing.[^14_Fu_4] Some are dating
sites where the relationship may not end up in marriage.[^14_Fu_5]

The personal profile includes basic demographic information, such as
age, gender, physical attributes, hobbies and interests, as well as
traits one seeks in a prospective dating partner.[^14_Fu_6] Users can decide
whether or not to upload photos as part of the profile.

Longer bachelorhood, time constraints due to busy schedules and more
geographical mobility contribute to the popularity of finding an online
date. With the stigma related to online dating gradually
dissipating,[^14_Fu_7] online dating has become the second most widely used
way for seeking a partner, only after connecting through friends.[^14_Fu_8]

China’s unmarried population between 18 and 55 accounted for 14.5
percent of the total in 2011, among whom 85 million were women.[^14_Fu_9] With
the issue of the new Marriage Law,[^14_Fu_10] arranged marriage was banned in
1950,[^14_Fu_11] which empowered Chinese women to freely choose their
partners. After more than a decade of development since the first online
dating site came into being in 1998 in China,[^14_Fu_12] 23.8 percent of
survey respondents said online dating was a reliable way to get to know
a potential date.[^14_Fu_13]

The present study focuses on how in Shanghai, China’s most populous
city, a “special” social group – *shengnv* – presented themselves on a
dating site, Jiayuan.com, in pursuit of a heterosexual relationship. It
also explores the social implications of the self-presentation and
mate-selection criteria in personal profiles as to how it challenges the
stereotypical gender-roles of Chinese women.

## *Shengnv* and Marriage Traditions in China

In the West, well-educated and professionally successful women are
considered to be independent and liberated.[^14_Fu_14] Their Chinese peers,
however, are less fortunate and even stigmatized as leftovers. The word,
*shengnv*, sometimes *shengnu*, or “leftover women,” refers to
well-educated, economically successful urban single women in their late
20s and older.[^14_Fu_15] *Shengnv* became an official word listed by the
Ministry of Education of China in 2007.[^14_Fu_16] In 2010, All-China Women’s
Federation, with other organizations, conducted and released a survey on
Chinese people’s attitude toward love and marriage. The results showed
that more than 90 percent of the males thought women should get married
before 27.[^14_Fu_17] Similar results were found in another survey conducted
by Baihe.com,[^14_Fu_18] a dating Web site. Some 62.2 percent of male
respondents and 64.8 percent females said the ideal age for women to get
married was between 25 and 27.[^14_Fu_19] Another 28.4 percent of men said 20
to 24 was the ideal marriage age for women, while 22.7 percent of women
said the age should be between 28 and 30.[^14_Fu_20] Women older than 25 were
subdivided into four categories: 25 and above, must fight for a partner;
28 and above, must triumph; 31 to 35, advanced leftovers; and older than
35, ultimate leftovers.[^14_Fu_21]

Even though China is known for its skewed male and female ratio
estimated to produce a surplus of 24 million men by 2020,[^14_Fu_22] except
for some less educated males in rural China, it is still *shengnv* who
are undergoing more challenges and pressures on the way to the altar.
The reasons are complicated. China is a marriage-oriented society.
Chinese marriage patterns are characterized by universality of marriage,
early marriage, female hypergamy, marriage squeeze and marriage as the
precursor to family formation.[^14_Fu_23]

As is the case with the older generation of American women, for whom
marriage was a core life experience,[^14_Fu_24] 98 percent of Chinese women
are married in the end.[^14_Fu_25] Marriage is considered the final
destination for women since taking care of family and children are
culturally considered women’s duties. Women were found to get more
satisfaction than men from marriage.[^14_Fu_26] Therefore, if a woman remains
single after 25, especially after 30, she is considered incomplete and
abnormal.[^14_Fu_27]

China has the tradition of hypergamy, or “marrying up”, for a woman to
marry a man who is more economically well-off and better educated.[^14_Fu_28]
Women gain financial security, status, and resources through marrying
older men.[^14_Fu_29] Chinese men, on the other hand, tend to “marry
down”.[^14_Fu_30] They tend to look for younger women as a future partner
since males emphasize physical attractiveness and youth.[^14_Fu_31] Studies
also show richer men get married later in life than do less well-to-do
men.[^14_Fu_32] About 12 million unmarried men will compete with younger men
for younger women.[^14_Fu_33] In the 2010 survey conducted by All-China
Women’s Federation, 38.3 percent of the male participants hoped that the
ideal occupation of their significant other could be teachers, followed
by civil servants, doctors/nurses, and accountants.[^14_Fu_34] Such jobs
usually bring women decent salaries, social status and relatively easy
working conditions. More than half of the male participants said they
did not care about their significant other’s job, which indicated that
males hoped that women could spend more time taking care of the
family.[^14_Fu_35]

Those well-educated and financially independent women thus are faced
with the embarrassment of having few men who want to marry a more
capable wife who is no longer “young,” at least in some Chinese sense.
The survey conducted by Jiayuan.com, an online dating site, confirmed
this paradox – the more education and salaries women have, the more
difficult it is for them to find a husband.[^14_Fu_36] These well-educated
urban professional women must downplay their high achievements since
they do not want to pressure prospective dates.[^14_Fu_37]

As a result of their cosmopolitan lifestyle, some Chinese women living
in big cities, such as Shanghai, date foreign men.[^14_Fu_38] These women’s
international love stories become an important construct of their
cosmopolitan identity.[^14_Fu_39] These Shanghainese women choose to marry
*laowai*, or foreigners, also because Chinese have the stereotype that
*laowai* are superior to Chinese and relatives and friends are less
likely to gossip about the past of the foreign partner.[^14_Fu_40]

## Theoretical Framework

### Self-presentation 

Self-presentation is “an individual accentuates certain matters and
conceals others.”[^14_Fu_41] It “refers to the process by which individuals
attempt to control the impressions others have of them.”[^14_Fu_42] In this
sense, the personal profile on online dating sites is a
self-presentation of the dater who posts it. Since prospective dates
will use the self-presentation to decide whether or not to initiate a
relationship,[^14_Fu_43] online personal profiles set the tone for future
relationship development.

Earlier studies on personal advertisements in newspapers found gender
stereotypes influenced how both women and men described themselves.[^14_Fu_44]
Females are more likely to show instrumental or male-valued traits.[^14_Fu_45]
They are more likely to display physical attractiveness such as
thinness, and to seek professional status[^14_Fu_46] or financially secure
older men.[^14_Fu_47]

These self-presentation traits women showed in personal advertisements
are in accordance with social exchange theory, which posits that each
party in a relationship tries to maximize its reward at minimal
cost.[^14_Fu_48] Social exchange theory, originated from behavioral
psychology,[^14_Fu_49] has been attested for examining marital and familial
relationships.[^14_Fu_50] Walther found reduced cues and asynchronicity, two
features of CMC, facilitated selective self-presentation.[^14_Fu_51] These,
plus editability, enable online daters to select and edit what to
present to their potential partners[^14_Fu_52] and manage their impression and
the relationship.[^14_Fu_53]

### Mate-selection Factors

Various factors affect how people choose prospective partners.
Heterosexual women and men have different preferences concerning traits
most desirable in prospective partners. Heterosexual women rated social
status the most valued while heterosexual men most frequently cited
attractiveness.[^14_Fu_54]

In studying Malaysian graduate students, Alavi, Alahdad and Shafeqfound
found they not only cared about exterior traits, but also interior ones
such as religion.[^14_Fu_55] Age is another factor in mate-selection. Hill
found that among college students, males preferred prospective partner
to be younger while females preferred older partners.[^14_Fu_56] Out of 18
factors, six were rated most important by both male and female
participants: dependable character, emotional stability and maturity,
pleasing disposition, mutual attraction, good health, and desire for
home life and children.[^14_Fu_57] Women also cited ambition and
industriousness; education and general intelligence; and good financial
prospects, while men said women should take care of the family and be
physically attractive.[^14_Fu_58] A cross-cultural study showed a similar
trend that women tended to value financial capacity, ambition,
industriousness and cues to resource acquisition in prospective partners
more than did men.[^14_Fu_59] Physically attractive women had elevated
standards for potential male partner’s characteristics, including good
genetic indicators, good investment indicators, good parenting
indicators, and good partner indicators.[^14_Fu_60] Schwarz and Hassebrauck
said in their study of heterosexuals aged 18 to 64 that slightly older
women were tolerable to men and much younger women were more
acceptable.[^14_Fu_61] The trends for women are different: as women mature
they tend to accept men younger than their own age.[^14_Fu_62] Slightly more
than one-third of women said they could imagine marrying a man earning
much less money than they did.[^14_Fu_63] In terms of education, many women
said they could not imagine marrying a less-educated partner, and one
not regularly employed.[^14_Fu_64] Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer and Kenrick
agreed that men prefer physically more attractive mates, while women
prefer mates who are more well-educated, self-confident, intelligent,
dominant, well-off and respected.[^14_Fu_65] Henry, Helm and Cruz’s comparison
of 18 desirable traits among college students in mate selection with the
studies from 1939 to 2011 also agreed that women preferred of men who
were ambitious, industrious and financially well off.[^14_Fu_66]

Chinese people’s mate selection criteria have been changing and
inconsistent as a result of the great social changes. Traditional
values, socialist reconstruction, utilitarianism and consumerism have
exerted their influence to different generations of Chinese since the
founding of the New China in 1949.[^14_Fu_67] Li’s study of 300 personal
advertisements found Chinese men attached more importance to income and
household registration,[^14_Fu_68] while Chinese women valued personality,
height and educational level.[^14_Fu_69] Urban residents cared more about
educational levels while rural Chinese favored marital status and
income.[^14_Fu_70] More-educated Chinese emphasized knowledge, moral conduct,
shared values and emotions that may help the couple to communicate
better spiritually.[^14_Fu_71] Based on evolutionary psychological analyses,
Tian found “good genes,” “good provider” and “good-father” to be factors
Chinese female college students and professional women preferred in mate
selection.[^14_Fu_72] These criteria help ensure male candidate can provide
the physical good genes, good socio-economic status, and good
personality traits the future generation needs.[^14_Fu_73] It is also
confirmed that urban-rural differences, educational levels and household
incomes, along with some other factors, affected Chinese female college
students’ preference in mate selection.[^14_Fu_74] But, on the whole, Tian’s
study concluded that modern Chinese female college students valued
personal traits more than material criteria.[^14_Fu_75]

All of these findings show that to the more educated urban Chinese
residents, are unconcerned whether or not their mate is well-educated.
Rather, they care more about good spiritual communication with their
partner. Rural residents, however, were more practical.

Shanghainese *shengnv* are on the whole economically successful and no
longer young. Accordingly, what personal traits do they highlight in the
exchange? Since their need for financial security is comparatively
lower, what do they look for in the relationship?

Based on the literature, the following research questions (RQ) were
posited:

> RQ1: How do heterosexual never-married *shengnv* present themselves in
> online dating profiles?
>
> RQ2: What kind of prospective partners do heterosexual never-married
> *shengnv* look for?

## Method

### Dating Site Selection 

Baihe, Jianyuan, and Zhenai are the top three dating sites with high
brand recognition rate and large number of users.[^14_Fu_76] Jiayuan.com,
founded in 2003 and listed on the NASDAQ in May, 2011, was chosen for
this study because it has more than 100 million registered users – more
than that of other competitors.[^14_Fu_77] Jiayuan.com offers open access to
most information of its users, making data collection and further
analysis possible.

The researcher registered to have more access to other users’ personal
profiles.[^14_Fu_78] But in the personal statement part, it was clearly stated
that the registration was for academic study, not partner or
relation-seeking. Thus the status was set as “I have found my partner.”

### Sample Selection

Shanghai is the largest city in China with a total population of 23
million.[^14_Fu_79] Shanghai does not see a skewed female vs. male ratio
though it is prevalent nationally in China. It was about 100:106 among
Shanghai residents.[^14_Fu_80] In the study of two-sex marriage pattern in
Shanghai, it was found that people in this city preferred to marry at an
older age.[^14_Fu_81] Since their male counterparts hold a similar view, the
likelihood for Shanghai females to find a good match remains
moderate.[^14_Fu_82] However, since 1991, more males than females got married
in Shanghai, which resulted in women from other areas in China being
“imported” to Shanghai and threatening native Shanghai women’s marriage
market.[^14_Fu_83] Females in Shanghai felt more satisfied with the status of
being married than males.[^14_Fu_84] Males of 21 to 25 said they greatly
preferred not to marry older female partners, although mature males did
not find this to be of concern.[^14_Fu_85]

*Shengnv* often designates urban single women 27 and above. Those women
“in the age range of 28-33 had more relevant and interesting
relationship experience to share.”[^14_Fu_86]

In this study, “female,” “28-33,” “Shanghai,”[^14_Fu_87] “never-married,”
“with photos” and “undergraduate and above,” were set as filters for
“gender,” “age,” “location,” “marital status,” “with or without photos”
and “educational level” to generate the samples in April, 2014.
According to Jiayuan.com, users posting photos received 11 times more
responses than those without photos. Since ethnicity and religion were
not Chinese people’s top priority in mate selection,[^14_Fu_88] they were not
included in this study. The fact that the vast majority of Chinese are
Han and atheists (or agnostics or pantheists) is accountable for
this.[^14_Fu_89] On each result page, there were 5x5 candidates. The personal
profile of each candidate was searched and content analyzed until a
desirable number was reached (*N* = 200). Each user’s personal profile
was used as the unit of analysis.

### Coding Categories

At Jiayuan.com, users register by providing information about their
gender, date of birth, marital status, height, educational level,
monthly income, email account or phone number for contact and an online
nickname. Users can fill in more information about children, blood type,
ethnicity, profession, housing, car and self tags. Love Monologue (*wode
neixin dubai*) is a self-disclosure section where registered users can
write 5 to 500 Chinese characters to show their understanding of love
and their expectation of marriage. Each user can upload one face
close-up and other photos at My Pics (*wode zhaopian)*. Users can
substantiate their profiles with physical features, work and study,
daily life, and hobbies at Detailed Information (*xiangxi ziliao*).
Personality Show (*gexing zhanshi*) describes the user’s personal
traits, opinions on love, dating, expectation of marriage, life after
the wedding and features of ideal partners. My Criteria (*wode zeou
yaoqiu*) are specific bars a prospective partner might meet. At Jiayuan
Self-Tag (*wode jiayuan biaoqian*), users can self-choose some tags that
best describe their personality. Physical Features (*waimao tixing*)
about height, weight and face shape also are open for fill-in.

In the present study, each user’s Jiayuan ID and her Jiayuan nickname
were recorded for future retrieval. Demographic information of all
participants was collected, including age, height, educational level,
income, car ownership, house ownership, professions, types of employers
and language proficiency (e.g. Mandarin, English and Spanish).

The following were coded to answer the first research question:
self-evaluation (e.g. cute and petite, mature and regal), and self-tags
(e.g. beautiful, career-oriented, cute, rational, straightforward).

The Ideal Partner (*lixiang duixiang*) part was coded for answering the
second research question. It included personalities of him (e.g.
gentleman-like, humorous, romantic or stylish), most valued trait (e.g.
responsible, humble, accommodating, honest), and what is most important
(e.g. physical features, personality, financial capacity, education).
The ideal age and height ranges, geographic location (e.g. in Shanghai,
in Shanghai’s neighboring areas, abroad), education (e.g. 3-year
college, undergraduate, graduate), and marital status (e.g. single,
divorced) of the prospective partner in My Criteria were coded as well.

Love Monologue was analyzed to address both research questions. The
coding procedures for Love Monologue were adapted from those used by
Harrison and Saeed,[^14_Fu_90] Deaux and Hanna,[^14_Fu_91] Keostner and
Wheeler,[^14_Fu_92] and Gonzales and Meyers.[^14_Fu_93] Three categories:
attractiveness, financial security and sincerity, were used to code this
subjective description in an offer/seek dichotomous manner. The details
of these qualities were:

> *Attractiveness*: petite, cute, slender, attractive, shapely, classy,
> sophisticated
>
> *Financial security*: accomplished, well-established, professional,
> generous, prosperous, successful
>
> *Sincerity*: committed, faithful, dependable, good morals, honest,
> trust-worthy, loyal

The researcher did most of the coding since it was objective. A graduate
student who is a Chinese native was trained and then coded the Love
Monologue section as a second coder. An acceptable intercoder
reliability[^14_Fu_94] was reached for seeking attractiveness (Cronbach’s α =
.93), offering attractiveness (Cronbach’s α = .89), seeking financial
security (Cronbach’s α = .86), offering financial security (Cronbach’s α
= .95), seeking sincerity (Cronbach’s α = .89) and offering sincerity
(Cronbach’s α = .86). All coding results were entered into Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis.

## Findings

### Demographic Information

Since the age of the subjects were pre-set, there was no big age
difference (*M* = 30.14, *SD* = 1.61) among all informants. Their
average height was 163.7 cm[^14_Fu_95] though individual difference ranged
from about 152 cm[^14_Fu_96] to 178 cm.[^14_Fu_97] Most (94 %) of the subjects
posted fewer than six photos. The personal information filled by
*shengnv* themselves affirmed the labels attached to them – more
educated and more well-to-do. About two thirds had bachelor’s or dual
degrees. The other one-third held graduate degrees (Table 1). About 81
percent of them had a monthly income of US\$800 to US\$3,200[^14_Fu_98] (see
Table 2).The high income made them out-compete women in other areas
considering the annual per capita disposable income[^14_Fu_99] of urban
households in Shanghai was US\$7,174[^14_Fu_100] in 2013, the highest among
all provinces. The high income may be the result of being employed by
companies and institutions with good welfare. Most of the informants
worked for foreign enterprises (29%), private-owned enterprises (19.5%),
public institutions (13%) and *Fortune* 500-enlisted companies (10%).
The rest worked for listed companies (7%), state-owned enterprises
(5.5%), and the government (2%). There were also a few running their own
companies (5.5%) or unknown (8.5%). The subjects’ economic competence
was also reflected by their car and property ownership and their
professional distribution. Some 16.5 percent of the informants had a car
and 15.5 percent had bought an apartment of their own. Those who have
not bought a car accounted for 52.5 percent with the rest being unknown.
As for housing, on a descending scale, these ladies chose “live with
parents” (42.5 %), “have not purchased yet” (10.0 %), “rent on my own”
(5.5 %), “will buy as needed” (3.5 %), “live in employer-offered
housing” (2.5 %), “rent with others” (2 %) or “unknown” (17.5 %). As
professional women, 52 percent of the subjects worked in
finance/security/insurance, accounting/auditing, IT/computer, human
resources, education/training and academic/research.

  Ph.D.             11          5.5
  Dual Bachelor’s   2           1.0

Since *shengnv* is a well-educated group, all subjects in this study
showed good language competence as a result of Chinese university’s
curriculum that prescribes a foreign language, usually English, as
compulsory. About three fifths of the informants could speak English.
Another 19 percent were good at English and another foreign language,
such as Japanese or German. About 3 percent showed proficiency in a
non-English foreign language. The rest were dismissive to this section
and left it uncompleted.

### RQ1: How do heterosexual never-married shengnv self-present themselves in online dating profiles?

In the self-tag section, registered Jiayuan users can choose at least
one tag that best represents their personalities. Among users who
completed this self-tag question (*n* = 182), the most frequently chosen
tags were *shanliang*, or kind-hearted; *xiaoshun*, showing great filial
piety; and *zhishuang*, or straight-forward (Table 3). Eighteen out of
the 200 informants’ response to this question was unknown.

In another self-evaluation, in which users were asked to choose one
four-character word to best describe their quality, 52 (26%) informants
left it blank. Among the 148 who answered, about half chose to describe
themselves as *mei qing mu xiu*, or having delicate facial features
(22%); and *xiu wai hui zhong*, or with an elegant look and intelligent
mind (16.5%). About 10 percent of the informants did not think they were
middle-aged but described themselves as young and energetic, or *qing
chun huo li*, as the Chinese would say. The others featured quietness
and gracefulness, shortness and sweetness, mature attractiveness, bright
eyes and regality and magnificence (Table 4).

### RQ2: What kind of prospective partners do heterosexual never-married shengnv look for?

As for their prospective partner’s personality, informants valued
“responsible” (32.5%) the most, according to 89 percent who answered. It
was followed by “honest” (18.7%), “accommodating” (17%) and
“considerate” (13.2%). Other less-cared personalities include
“self-constraint” (5.3%), “patient” (4.3%), “full of hope” (3.9%),
“modest” (1.8%), “satisfied” (1.2%), “friendly” (1.2%), “empathetic”
(0.4%), “persevering” (0.2%) and “sympathetic”(0.2%).

In another similar question, the 175 informants who answered hoped their
significant others could have a calm character and take good care of the
family (*wen zhong gu jia*) (27.7%), optimistic and positive (*le guan
ji ji*) (26.1%), humorous (*feng qu you mo*) (17.5%), wise and brilliant
(*jing ming rui zhi*) (11.6%), and gentleman-like (*wen wen er ya*)
(10.6%). But the informants did not seem to be in favor of qualities
such as extroverted (1.8%), childlike (1.8%), careful and cautious
(1.0%), romantic (1.0%), impulsive (0.4%) and stylish (0.4%).

The average minimal (*M* = 29.6, *SD* = 2.05) and maximum (*M* = 37.8,
*SD* = 3.08) age of ideal prospective partners spanned eight years. The
average minimal (*M* = 172.4[^14_Fu_102], *SD* = 3.61) and maximum (*M* =
186.5[^14_Fu_103], *SD* = 5.26) height span was 14 cm.

The informants, on the whole, cared about earlier romance of their
prospective partner. They preferred to date men who remained single
(66%). Only 28.5 percent did not care whether their prospective partner
had or not tied the knot before.

Informants sought a similar educational background in their prospective
partners. Three-quarters of the informants looked for candidates with at
least a college education. About 10.5 percent was OK with a three-year
college education though another 3 percent of women emphasized that
their prospective partner, ideally, should have at least a master’s
degree. To 11 percent of these women, the educational level of their
future significant other seemed unimportant.

Most informants (87.5%) specified that the man should be working and
living in Shanghai, followed by Shanghai and abroad (4%). Others chose
Shanghai and its neighboring big cities or other cities in China.

Among the four elements most valued, personality (83%) was the most
outstanding for the informants. They cared much less about their
significant other’s financial ability (2.5%), education (2%) and
physical features (1%). Another 11.5 percent did not respond.

The analysis of Love Monologue confirmed that financial security did not
seem to be what *shengnv* desired. They also offered little financial
security. However, physical and personality attractiveness and sincerity
were more desirable (Table 5).

What *Shengnv* Seek and Offer in Love Monologue

                             Yes     No
  -------------------------- ------- -------
  Seek attractiveness        51.5%   48.5%
  Offer attractiveness       52.5%   47.5%
  Seek financial security    14.5%   85.5%
  Offer financial security   15%     85%
  Seek sincerity             57%     43%
  Offer sincerity            50.5%   49.5%

## Discussion

*Shengnv* in the present study tended to emphasize their personality and
intelligence rather than physical attractiveness when self-presenting at
dating websites. Many of them chose “*qi zhi nv*”, “*xiu wai hui
zhong*”, and “*mei qing mu xiu*” as their self-presentation. All of such
tags emanate their elegance, brilliance and charm as a result of their
education and knowledge. They preferred to choose chrysanthemum as their
avatar, blooming in autumn while most other flowers come out in spring.
It symbolizes the character of being unwilling to compete with others
and persevering in Chinese culture. Therefore, chrysanthemum is
different from the flamboyant peony, figuratively, “*yong rong hua
gui*”, which was chosen by a fraction of informants.

As a group that has been exposed to higher education and working in
foreign enterprises and *Fortune* 500-enlisted companies, *shengnv*
presented a combination of traditional virtues of Chinese women and
Western influence. Confucian virtues emphasized women’s compliance,
modesty, and caring for the parents.[^14_Fu_104] Many informants in this study
selected “kind-heartedness” and “filial piety” as their self-tags.
Vicky, a participant, wrote in About Me, “Elegant enough to show around
to guests and diligent enough to make tasty cuisines; demure as a maiden
and agile as a rabbit; gentle and kind; caring and elegant.” Rachel
said, “To better take care of my parents, men living outside of Shanghai
will not be considered.” By the same token, informants sought filial
piety in their prospective partners. Soul Coffee wrote, “I hope he can
[…] show filial piety to his parents. Those who are immature and
disrespectful to parents, please stay away from me.” A Ning mentioned,
“I hope he is filial to his parents, virtuous and aspiring.” Some
*shengnv* in this study also looked forward to Western lifestyle and
taste. They referred to themselves as “*xiao zi nv*”, translated from
“petit bourgeoisie”, who are office workers for foreign companies with
good English proficiency and education, consuming foreign products and
enjoying Western art.[^14_Fu_105] So it is not surprising that four percent of
the informants wished their prospective partner could be either in
Shanghai or abroad. Xiaoxiong got her undergraduate education abroad and
self-claimed as a Christian. Some key words she used to describe herself
were Hong Kong-style milk tea/church/American TV dramas/European and
American pop music. She said, “I don’t care about his location. But it
would be better should he live and work in Shanghai/Zhejiang[^14_Fu_106]/Hong
Kong/abroad.” This again confirmed Farrer’s observation that dating a
foreigner was an outcome of their cosmopolitan lifestyle.[^14_Fu_107] The
divergent preference of Shanghai *shengnv* shows Chinese values for
women maintain persistent bearing on them. However, global mobility has
also expanded the spectrum for their mate selection.

Their educational background and decent jobs enlarged *shengnv*’s
horizons and empowered them financially. Maggie worked as a consultant,
making more than 20,000 yuan[^14_Fu_108] a month. Her self-disclosure was
representative. She said, “I spend most time on my work. (But my time is
flexible.) After all, dedicating to my career gives me the sense of
achievement. Before I settle down with a family of my own, I would love
to devote myself to things with output. After all, having sufficient and
disposable money is one of the cornerstones of the beautiful future […]
I hope I can have some power of influence in my own field. Of course, I
want to be financially free as soon as possible. I will never want to
retire. Work is part of life.”

Therefore, *shengnv* pursued personality and sincerity more than
financial security. Xiaoyou said, “I am not that much materialistic.
Don’t care much about houses or cars. It will be good to make these come
true with you. But most importantly, you should be a smart and aspiring
man.” Ling, who studied and worked abroad before, emphasized, “I prefer
independence in thoughts and finance. So I don’t want my emotional life
to be bothered by materialistic standards. I look for a healthy,
easy-going, down-to-earth, and accommodating guy who has the same values
as me.”

Considering the extensive media coverage and presentation of
extra-marital affairs, sense of responsibility and honesty were the
most-sought disposition. Some personal profiles also showed the social
pressure to *shengnv*. They even used this label for self-reference.
Xyxy wrote, “Even though I’m already an aging *shengnv*, nothing can
prevent me from showing my love to life. I won’t make do with a man
easily […] If you are sincere to me, I will reward with sincerity,
treating you and your family well.” Arrogant Dinosaur asked herself,
“How come I become leftovers? But I am a leftover woman now.” Jiayuan’s
investigation about *shengnv* showed that more than half of the women
aged 28-33 acknowledged the identity as a leftover woman.[^14_Fu_109]
Sixty-six percent of shengnv thought this word was neutral and their
high education and income exacerbated the likelihood of becoming
leftovers.[^14_Fu_110]

The pressing need to make themselves married urged these women to
emphasize sincerity. Jingjing appealed, “I’m hoping my Mr. Right can
show up as soon as possible so that I can complete this task before the
end of this year.” XX emphasized, “The purpose for registering at
Jiayuan is to seek my *yinyuan*.[^14_Fu_111] Please do not bother me if you
are divorced, widowed, younger than 33, older than 40, just for fun,
hitting on girls, or not for getting married.” Xiaoxiong said, “Hope
GG[^14_Fu_112] is as sincere as me, dating for marriage.” Such attitudes to
online courtship reflects a popular saying in China – falsely believed
to be said by Mao – Dating that did not lead to the altar is
hooliganism. But the soliloquies also disclose *shengnv*’s desperation
for love when they no longer have impending professional or financial
concerns and their serious attitude to dating and marriage. Chinese
parents tend to urge their children to work hard during their school
years, especially those high-achieving students. Unlike their American
counterparts, who start dating as teenagers, people who study hard in
China usually devote too much time to their school work. When they are
out of college, their parents then press them to be married. When they
reach the “leftover” age, the need to be married, from parents and
society, becomes more intense.

Living and working in China’s largest city, these Shanghainese women
showed unique preference to Shanghai native men. They either used “I’m a
Shanghainese” as the opening remark of their profiles or specified that
“Please do not bother if you are not a native of Shanghai.” Emily
explained that she was hoping her future significant other could speak
Shanghai dialect and be immersed into Shanghai culture. Yueming said,
“I’m an obedient Shanghai girl […] For the sake of having the same
lifestyle, I prefer guys born and brought up in Shanghai. If not, please
do not bother me. Thanks.” The survey about love stories in four
metropolises showed that 73.2 percent of Shanghainese hoped their
significant other could be a native of Shanghai, too.[^14_Fu_113] In the
present study, the percentage was even higher.

## Conclusion

This study about the self-presentation and mate-selection criteria of
leftover Shanghainese women shows that traditional Chinese culture still
influences modern Chinese women. Shanghai, a global city and China’s
largest metropolitan area, also affects the mate selection of these
women. Good education, decent income and social pressures all encourage
Shanghai *shengnv* to pursue sincerity disposition rather than financial
security in online courtship.

Future research may explore differences in personal profiles of Chinese
women of all ages at online dating sites since they were brought up in
different historical eras in which China transformed from a socialist,
planned-economy and Confucian society into a consumerism-dominated,
economically robust powerhouse. The change of values brought by the
social upheaval may affect Chinese women’s self-presentation and
mate-selection criteria, and warrants more study. *Shengnv* accounts for
only a small percentage of all Chinese women. Media coverage, especially
by Western press, has drawn more attention to this social group.
However, Chinese women who have migrated to urban areas to make a living
should be studied as well. Their rigid and long work schedules, limited
social capital in cities and less-competent digital literacy make the
courtship of migrant women merit further research.
