    <Content>Globalization is often thought of in terms of global flows of capital. But when one takes note of the forms of capital that flow in a globalized world – money, products, labor, specialized knowledge, it is hard to ignore the role of humans in these transnational flows. As subjects migrate and reimagine space, ICTs impact the maintenance of family and other social ties, cultural production and consumption, and pursuit of intimacy, love, and marriage for members of the South Asian diaspora. In addition to using ICTs to maintain local and national ties, South Asians on the Indian subcontinent and in the diaspora also use ICTs to seek out information and communication on a transnational scale, creating transnational ethnoscapes, technoscapes, and mediascapes, a dynamic interplay between people, technology, and audio/visual media.</Content>

    <Content>This chapter distinguishes itself among other studies of contemporary arranged marriage amongst South Asians by focusing on the practices of U.S. diasporic South Asians and by acknowledging the many actors – human and non-human – that factor into the arranged marriage process amongst this social group. In what follows, we use the term “South Asian diaspora,” even though the subjects in the study are of Indian descent. Though there are small regional differences in marriage practices between villages, cities, nations, regions, and religious and ethnic groups, the coeval existence of arranged and love marriages, matchmakers and Internet sites is standard for many across the region and its diaspora.</Content>

    <Content>Within South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, marriages are popularly conceived in one of two genres: the arranged marriage or the love marriage. In this formulation, love marriages are tied to modernity, or, alternatively, to “Western culture.” This kind of analysis may or may not acknowledge that in the West, love became a priority in the pursuit of marriages only in the eighteenth century.</Content>

    <Content>From a very young age, children are socialized to identify with the family as a whole and discouraged from developing an autonomous self. They are conditioned to place the interests of the family ahead of their own. Alienating and confronting parents and family is still an anathema to most young people, especially in important decisions such as career selection and marriage. Furthermore, cultural mores frown upon the socialization among men and women in the form of dating and relationships. As a result, arranged marriage is still the dominant way for families and individuals to find partners for marriage.</Content>

    <Content>After interviews, subjects were asked if they knew any South Asians in the area who used matrimonial or dating sites. All interviews were done in person or over Skype in early 2014. From the ten subjects, who ranged from 26 to 35 years old, three were male, and seven were female. Most conversations were about heterosexual courtship, although one subject self-identified as bisexual. Of the men, two were born in the US and one was born in India; of the women, five were born in the US and two were born in India. All seven subjects born in the US are first-generation Americans. Their religious affiliations, which included Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, were revealed over the course of interviews as it became important for their courtship practices. All subjects have ethnic ties to North India; they sometimes brought up their regional ethnicities when those ethnicities played a factor in the pursuit of mates. Our subjects’ steady access to high-speed Internet at home and on their mobile phones were trappings of their presumed membership within the American middle class. We coded each interview subject with a number, which was used throughout to identify different subjects. A list of subjects with age, gender, birth country, and religion, when provided, is provided in the Appendix. Interviews were transcribed and coded based on themes that emerged, some of which are explored below.</Content>

Here, we borrow the term “remediation” from critics of digital aesthetic forms Bolter and Grusin to note the ways that, new media forms, in this case matrimonial sites and dating websites, transmute previous forms into something somehow experienced in a both more immediate and more hypermediated way.</Content>

    <Content>In 1995, a non-profit organization called Matri was founded by Yashvant Patel to assist Gujarati eligibles in New Jersey in their quest to find &quot;life partners&quot; that spoke Gujarati and shared common cultural values. At its inception, Matri focused on organizing annual conventions where hundreds of prospective brides, grooms and their parents across the U.S. gathered in business casual attire for a weekend of food, music, and dance as well as other social events that allowed people looking for marriage partners to meet each other. Before arriving at the annual convention, registered participants were asked to select the names of five prospects they would like to meet from a booklet of colored photographs and biodata profiles. At the event, participants were asked to walk on stage, share their name, registration number, and a brief introduction in 40 seconds or less. Afterwards, parents moved to a separate area for a parents meeting guided by adult volunteers, and young participants are broken up into groups for individual interviews.</Content>

    <Content> in addition to noting the cultural forces of diaspora, immigration, and the transnational, we should be attuned to the various human and non-human actors involved in matchmaking. We have identified the eligible young people, their parents and family, matchmakers, astrologists, dating and matrimonial sites, online profiles, and social matching algorithms as key actors within the system of South Asian diasporiccourtship. All of these actors have the capability to be considered matchmakers. If hybrid forms like assisted marriages are becoming popular for diasporic subjects, then what roles do these actors in arrangement play in various forms of courtship pursuit in the South Asian diasporic context? In answering this question, it is important to note that all ten subjects saw themselves as the primary agents in their pursuit of partners or dates.</Content>

I envision it being someone who doesn’t keep in touch with you but someone that covers your profile. They would have a brief conversation with you when you join the site or at the period of time you request just to get a sense of who you are. Maybe they could even record a Q&amp;A and then put it on the profile with the customer’s approval. And that person through other conversations could match up people rather than just relying on an algorithm. I know there are people in real life that do this. I like the big audience of Match, they would have to have someone to do it for a specialized group which is a high cost but also a smaller pool. Like in the traditional sense like an Indian matchmaker. I know this would cost more but augmenting the site with humans would result in more matches.

To compensate for the ways that the sites did not completely correspond with the ways he wanted to find eligibles, Participant 10 noted a number of ways that he could become attractive to other users: he would write more when responding to questions, be more active on sites that allow one to write more, fill out as much as he found relevant in profiles, and used keywords that could help users and algorithms find him amongst the other profiles. So while he was submitting to the dating and matrimonial sites, he was more excited about the possibilities of human-mediated matchmaking. To make up for this incongruence, he tried to anticipate the structures of the matching algorithms and “game” the system so that his profile would be shown to as many other eligibles as possible.</Content>

    <Content>For those who are specifically designated as a matchmaker, one crucial tool to maintain a repository of eligibles is the biodata. Biodata allow matchmakers to keep track of the people who they are working with to find matches. Biodata fill the matchmakers’ database. These one-page entries, when used by professional matchmakers, are tools for mediating the process of arrangement. Whereas some arranged and assisted marriage connections are made by family or social ties that are made solely with the agency of the eligibles and/or their parents or other family members, biodata are a medium that are necessitated only by the presence of a separate matchmaker. They are a technology of the matchmaker.</Content>

    <Content> The diasporic subjects in this study have all made a home for themselves in the United States, specifically in the New York City area in New York and New Jersey. Though it was not necessarily a surprise that the subjects considered sites that both do and do not market themselves specifically to the South Asian diasporic communities, we were surprised by the various ways that our subjects justified the sites that they used, especially as those justifications pertained to one’s pursuit of a suitor that fitted within a specific set of constraints.</Content>

    <Content>While all respondents considered both South Asian diasporic and multiethnic sites, most of them used some of both. For the most part, the subjects expressed a desire to browse or search South Asian-American eligibles. Many of our subjects mentioned their tactics for finding appropriate eligibles on a number of sites. On multiethnic sites targeted towards Americans, they spoke specifically about tactics to find other South Asians. To do this, users often used sites where they could sort through profiles by ethnicity. Ethnicity is also often listed on profiles on dating and matrimonial sites. The category South Asian, it turns out, isn’t particularly universally legible as a standard. On some sites, “South Asian” was a category. On sites where “Asian” was a category, but not “South Asian,” those looking for Hindu eligibles were able to narrow down their search results by using both the ethnicity and religion fields. On still other sites, “East Indian” was the particular designation that users needed to use.</Content>

    <Content>Another theme that arose throughout our interviews was the ways in which sites for South Asian users did not meet the needs of the diasporic subjects, and rather were too targeted towards users on the subcontinent. Without prompting, several of the subjects we interviewed specifically stated that they were not interested in the prospects of meeting someone living in India. Participant 1 noted, “They ask if you wanted to put your income or if you wanted to put HIV status, or your citizenship status. I don’t know. It felt like it was very much geared towards folks overseas.” Here, Participant 1 noted that the citizenship status felt out of place considering his own priorities, because he wanted to find eligibles who lived nearby and implied that a field for HIV status was unexpected and felt out-of-place. </Content>

    <Content>Many participants who were looking for South Asian-American mates were interested specifically in people with specific regional ethnic or religious identities, like Participant 6 above. For these subjects, membership in a site designed specifically for intra-group marriage was a part of the user’s repertoire of sites used. Often this was a spin-off of BharatMatrimony.com for specific ethnic groups, but sometimes it was a specific matrimonial site for a religious group. In one case, a subject used a small, elite secret site for members with a specific regional, ethnic and caste intersection. These examples show how affiliations specific to culture on the subcontinent are still important for the diasporic subjects.</Content>

    <Content>In this chapter, we have explored the use of dating and matrimonial sites by South Asian-Americans in the New York City metro area. In so doing, we have noted the ways that the various human and non-human actors in “traditional” matchmaking processes have been remediated, as have the tools involved in mediated matchmaking, and the users’ own diasporic identities and subjectivities. Understanding South Asian marriage as all about matchmaking and courtship and American/Western marriage as solely invested in the pursuit of love, dating, and/or sex, one simplifies the ways that modernity is actually experienced, and the many possibilities that modern or contemporary subjects engage in.</Content>

    <Content> Or, alternatively, we limit our definition of “love.” Instances of mediated matchmaking lay bare the technologized and mediated pursuit of courtship and its complicity in models of arrangement, assisted marriages, and, in fact, love. Diasporic subjectivity, as described in this essay, is a particularly interesting boundary object that points out the ways that various modes of relating are coeval in a contemporary globalized world. In considering the experiences of diasporic South Asians’ use of dating and matrimonial sites to pursue relationships, we are reminded of the various courses and pathways enabled by transnational ethno-, techno-, and mediascapes. As courts, legislatures, social scientists, and culture at large attempt to codify certain modes of marriage and courtship within the United States and other nations, it is helpful to be reminded of the many coexisting and varied models for these modes of relating.</Content>
