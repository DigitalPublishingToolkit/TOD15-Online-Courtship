    <Content>It is often argued that the rise of online dating reflects the increasing dominance of economic liberalism in western societies. This is said to extend even into the personal sphere where modern courtship is epitomised by the dating website which turns its customers into self-marketing managers of their own emotional capital. In that sense online dating is seen to represent a particular social constituency – the urban, late-marrying type, perhaps a member of the new white-collar “precariat” working in professional employment on short-term contracts, settling down much later, and as a result on the dating market for a correspondingly longer period.</Content>

    <Content>Whatever the rights and wrongs of that argument, changing patterns of courtship (and the rise of print and later digital media to arrange it) do reflect changes in the organisation of marriage, employment and the relationship of self and society. Although a successful market of this kind requires a free press and thriving print culture, in historical terms advertising for love has become popular in conjunction with three things: first, a mostly urban population of insecure workers seeking to break away from established courtship patterns; secondly, the idea of marriage as a contract freely entered into by contracting parties, and thirdly, some kind of announced “crisis” in marriage or romantic intimacy. The latter is normally discovered by more conservative voices, is often part of an attack on the contractual idea, and tends to see “modern marriage” (or partnership) as an unromantic and mercenary transaction.</Content>

    <Content>Arranging courtship or marriage via a third party is not especially modern. Many peasant or pre-industrial societies outside Western Europe practiced systems of arranged marriage – either via parents and close kin, or through the offices of a professional matchmaker and still do. In societies where production is based on the home, arranged or brokered marriages result from the importance of the marital couple as an economic unit, and their significance to local economic relations involving wider kin groups. The intervention of parents and community in the process of courtship reflected the effort to ensure that property would be transferred legitimately and that the new household would be able to make an effective and sustainable contribution to the economic life of the community. In the past historians have argued that the decay of this communal model and its replacement by one in which courtship was almost wholly determined by the wishes of the parties concerned reflected the emergence of free labour and capitalism. While the former model is characterised by the intervention of parents, kin and community, the latter is said to have been marked by the rise of romantic love, the personal choice of partners free from parental interference, and the establishment of a separate marital household. This transition, from the “arranged” system that belonged more to what is known as the “stem family” defined by broad kinship among a wide group of relatives, to one in which romantic love and free choice of partners is allowed has been seen as a significant moment of transition in Western history. Most famously, Lawrence Stone argued that the emphasis on the self and its wants over and above the needs of kinship, alliance, or economy, beginning in the late sixteenth century, highlighted the gradual rise of affective individualism, the decay of communality, and hence the coming of modernity. Critics of Stone were quick to point out that even in late-medieval texts, especially legal codes, individual choice and romantic love could be found as an element of marriage among all classes, and hence had to predate Stone’s chronology. Jack Goody and Alan Macfarlane see this individualistic model not as the creation of modernity, but of late-medieval Europe going back as far as the late thirteenth century. For them, the fact that canon law in medieval Europe defined marriage as an agreement of mutual consent between the parties concerned meant that the narrow conjugal family based on the couple, in which romantic love and not material interest is the prime motivation, was the norm in Western European history. </Content>

    <Content>In that sense, Stone’s critics have discounted any evidence of intermediaries, arrangements and closely-calculated marriage settlements that might reflect communal interest in or control over the conjugal couple as the exception rather than the rule. However, more recent work on northern Europe has pointed out that freedoms asserted (or legally codified) and freedoms practised are two different things and that in reality, most couples even in the West European marriage system had to deal with parental and community pressures. Actual courtship was a much more complex affair than the desiccated calculations of rationally-choosing subjects. Moreover, community interest was often at stake, and intermediaries were employed, even if their roles were not formalised or professional. As Diana O’Hara has pointed out, sixteenth-century Britain was not unfamiliar with brokers, “utterers,” “medlers” and “matrimonial bawds” who intervened in the process of courtship, not to mention the many aristocrats anxious over the destination of their estates. For instance, in 1664 it was said of the Duchess of Newcastle that “women do fee her to get them husbands, and men to get them rich wives, so as she is become the huckster, or broker of males and females…indeed she is a matrimonial bawd.”</Content>

    <Content>In northern Europe at least, the older model of communally-organised marriage gradually gave way from the late sixteenth century onwards. In these areas couples were expected to establish a separate household and so in order to marry they required access to property or an artisanal trade that would support them. However, by 1600 or so it was increasingly difficult to ensure that new couples could support themselves in this way, and a new category of “masterless men” or wage-earners began to emerge. John Gillis calculates that by 1600 around one third of the population no longer had access to land or trades, and that as a result they became increasingly detached from traditional customs and institutions and more willing to indulge in “private spousals.”</Content>

    <Content> By the early eighteenth century, Gillis calculates, perhaps one-third of marriages were outside the purview of communal custom. This process went hand in hand with the rise of Puritanism, which tended to narrow the courtship process to one that focussed primarily on the family and not the wider community. Two marriage practices reflected these changes: first, the custom of marriage by licence, in which the couple could (if they could afford it) pay the local bishop to marry them without publishing the banns and therefore attracting the interest of parents and others; and secondly, clandestine marriages conducted in mostly urban locales known as “liberties” in which ecclesiastical authority did not apply.</Content>

    <Content>This is the historical background against which we should see the rise of advertising for husbands and wives. Although the involvement of third parties in courtship did not necessarily mean that families or communities were not involved in the process, in general, we might take the development of advertising to reflect the rise of “private spousals” free from familial or community pressure. Advertising of this kind emerged in the 1680s or 1690s, about forty years after the appearance of the first newspapers.

However, other less conventional arrangements were also common in the 18th century, for instance, the gentleman who in 1768 expressed a desire to meet a “young lady dressed in a black nightgown, with a letter in her hand” whom he had followed about the City the previous Friday. Others seemed to be advertising openly for mistresses, such as the “Gentleman of independent fortune, in possession, and very considerable expectations” who in 1770 announced an intention to make a tour through France and Italy. He thought it would be “a particular happiness could he meet with an agreeable young lady, whose education and sentiments would engage his esteem and affections, to accompany him on his travels.” Other men advertised for single women to board with them possibly as a way of making an informal marriage.

    <Content>While individual advertisements began to be common in a wide variety of different papers, organised matrimonial agencies were also a feature of eighteenth century society. One such agency, which presented itself as the solution to the difficulties of modern marriage, was the Imprejudicate Nuptial Society, or the Grand Matrimonial Intercourse Institution, probably established in the mid-century. This organisation, run by a clergyman from an address in the City of London, presented itself as a philanthropic society which would enable more people to marry, thereby saving British morals and preventing the increase of “vagabond children.” The Rev. Watson, the proprietor, proposed to recruit clergymen in every town who would give sermons on the benefits of marriage, thereby collecting money which would be placed in a communal fund for those who could not afford marriage expenses. There would also be list of subscribers, divided into three classes according to income and property, the estimation of which was at the heart of the enterprise. Advertisers with the agency, such as the “Gentleman, 40 yrs of age…a little corpulent, rather of a dark complexion, wears his own hair,” were compelled to be honest about their status. He estimated his wealth at £200 per annum, with £750 in the public funds, and “a small Estate in Surry.” This method of proceeding, Rev Watson proclaimed, avoided “the common way” which was for men to fall in love, “and then disgracefully retreat, if there is not money enough.” In his scheme, as in most other matrimonial ads of this period, “the circumstances are first known, and nothing to prevent sincere love afterwards.”</Content>

    <Content>Allegations of fraud, which were to dog the matrimonial business for the rest of its days, quickly followed the rise of formal marriage brokers. In the early 1770s, a Mr R was supposed to have made a huge fortune in London by acting as an agent for young, rich women looking to marry. Every spring, he would place a series of ads in the press, offering to arrange marriages for ladies with fortunes of £30,000. These wealthy women would be installed at his house, while he again advertised for potential suitors, who, it was said, paid him as much as £500 for the privilege of paying court to his clients. He was then supposed to have “touched several five hundreds without the candidates for matrimony being successful,” and kept everybody dangling on a string while he pocketed the proceeds.</Content>

    <Content> Suspicions about the type of man who might advertise were compounded by one of the most famous crimes in British history, the murder of Maria Marten by her sweetheart William Corder at the infamous Red Barn in the village of Polstead in Suffolk in 1827. Part of the sensation that surrounded the trial of Corder in 1828 was the revelation that he had been a regular user of matrimonial columns. In that sense, the case offers a rare glimpse into the style of advertising in this period. In the winter of 1827, fleeing his crime which was still undetected, Corder moved to a tavern in the City of London, from where he took out ads in the </Content>

His announcement, headed “MATRIMONY,” described him as a “A Private Gentleman, aged 25, entirely independent,” seeking “any female of respectability, who would study for domestic comfort,” and who was willing “to confide her future happiness in one every way qualified to render the marriage state desirable.” He was, the ad said, a “sociable, tender, kind, and sympathising companion,” and instructed correspondents to write to Mr Foster’s stationer’s shop in the City, from where he would collect the letters. More than fifty replies came in from women mostly in their late teens and early twenties, and still more women came to Foster’s shop – later luridly described in the press as a “</Content>

Some respondents offered to pair him with their sisters, others did not want to meet him but preferred to get to know him first by an extended correspondence, and some wanted to arrange an interview at their homes. One reply instructed Corder to take a walk on the south side of Northampton Square in the City of London, between the hours of 12 and 1 on the following Monday, and to carry a white pocket-handkerchief. “I shall be there and may perhaps have an interview with you,” the writer promised.</Content>

    <Content>Corder eventually made the acquaintance of one Mary Moore and, with his past still completely unknown, offered the promise of marriage. Ms Moore’s mother was set against such a proceeding, mainly because the anonymity of the ad did not allow them to know or investigate Corder’s family connections. Her brother was also suspicious of this man who had appeared apparently from nowhere, and angrily denounced the whole business. However, as Miss Moore pointed out to him, the matrimonial ad was for financially independent individuals like herself who did not have to put up with the interference of their families. Most of Corder’s respondents were the same – they were young women who were distanced from parental interference, either through the death of parents or relatives, or through their own financial independence. Miss Moore, who had inherited some of her father’s wealth, was one of many such women. She told her brother “that she was fully satisfied in her own mind,” about Corder’s connections, “and urged that as she was her own mistress, she should use her own discretion, and in defiance of anything her brother might urge to the contrary, she should marry him on the morrow.”</Content>

The case resulted from the fact that in order to keep unsuccessful (and unappealing) male suitors on their books they had sent out form letters to a few advertisers from ladies that did not exist. The agency profited mainly from its personal services, for instance, charging some clients between £2 and £17 for such assistance in the marriage market, including personal interviews, advice and introductions. The trial also revealed the social constituency of matrimonial papers and agencies at this time. Its male clients were mainly shopkeepers and skilled workers, such as tobacconists, tailors, hairdressers, decorators, printers and other “well to do artisans,” while its female ones were mostly domestic servants and some widows with capital.</Content>

    <Content>It was widely held at the time that the matrimonial press provided a useful service to the generally impoverished white collar worker, who, uncertain of his income and status, could find respectability helpfully quantified by the requirement of most papers for the advertiser to state his or her income. Matrimonial ads were also seen as a response to the “surplus woman” problem that emerged from a gender imbalance in Britain’s population from the 1860s onwards. Another factor that assisted the rise of the matrimonial press was the increasingly popular idea of marriage as a type of negotiable contract. This view had emerged in the mid-nineteenth century in Britain as part of the attempt to reform the laws governing divorce and married women’s right to property. By the end of the century marriage-as-contract had a number of powerful feminist advocates including the writers Mona Caird and Cicely Hamilton, the latter the author of the 1909 protest against </Content>

    <Content>. The contractual idea appealed to feminists as it seemed to allow women to circumvent the suffocating restrictions of class, custom and family that dictated who and how a woman should marry. It also appeared to undermine the idea of patriarchal authority within marriage by suggesting that both parties met on the basis of equality. These ideas were accompanied by a widespread feeling that modern love had degenerated into a merely pragmatic and often monetary relation.</Content>

In the years following, Caird promoted the idea that marriage should evolve from primitive practices towards contractual agreement. She argued that science, and especially Charles Darwin, had shown that marriage had begun in savage practices like wife-capture, and the problem was that it continued in much the same coercive form. To break away from the “barbaric” elements of marital coercion, men and women should, Caird argued, “</Content>

    <Content> The problem then was how to invent a place where such contractual ideas could be put into practice. For an answer many progressive thinkers turned to the matrimonial advertisement and agency. Advocates of eugenically-influenced “rational reproduction” adopted it as a way round the “dsygenic” courtship practices associated with the rituals of respectability that prevented healthy men and women marrying across class boundaries, while others, such as the pioneering editor W. T. Stead established their own version of a social network. Stead’s idea, which ran from 1898 to 1903, was called the Round-About, and was modelled on a matrimonial agency but with the important difference that clients did not have to state a “matrimonial intention,” and could therefore interact without the anxiety thereby imposed. Men and women would see their ads in the Round-About newspaper, and then write to each other via a central office of the “Controller” where profiles of themselves were also kept. If the profile took your fancy, a correspondence would follow and if so inclined, marriage might result. This, Stead argued, was a key solution to the problem of modern urban alienation that especially afflicted the young white collar or professional worker living in what he called “the City of Dreadful Solitude.” Others also took up the matrimonial bureau as a philanthropic idea and rational solution to modern problems, including the founder of the Salvation Army, William Booth. He envisaged a “colony scheme” – a gigantic programme for exporting Britain’s urban poor to Canada and Australia, part of which would be a matrimonial agency ensuring that healthy marriages were made.</Content>

Similarly, suggestive self-descriptions such as “unconventional” or “bohemian” were banned.

Stories of girls disappearing into white slavery through its columns began to circulate in the more sensational newspapers, and the police began to take a keener interest. Although they discovered very little evidence of prostitution by women, the authorities did uncover a series of ads that appeared to be arranging contacts between gay men, and which were therefore more obviously illegal. In their ads, these men commonly cited a canon of homosexual heroes, from Hercules and Iolaus to Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde, declared themselves “theatrical,” “musical,” and “sincere,” before announcing a willingness to meet a potential friend or chum, “own sex.” In 1921, a police investigation of these ads, and a discovery of a cache of intimate letters between two men who had met through the </Content>

After 1921 the requirement to state a matrimonial intent was restored to its dominance and it was not really until the 1960s that the dubious status of the lonely hearts ad ended. Correspondence clubs such as the longest-lasting one, the Universal (established in 1916 and still in existence in the 1940s) continued to exist, and others grew up at the end of World War Two to cater for a newly-perceived epidemic of solitude and a short-lived post-war boom in divorce (that peaked in 1948 and soon fell away to almost nothing in the 1950s). However, these “friendship” organisations, such as the Victory Correspondence Club or the Two-Ways Correspondence Club, remained on a small scale and most were run by an odd collection of ex-military men from their homes in provincial towns and seaside resorts.</Content>

Its widespread use in these forms, as well as to facilitate straight lonely hearts and the contacts of gay men, made it unlikely that any further attacks on the latter would be successful.
