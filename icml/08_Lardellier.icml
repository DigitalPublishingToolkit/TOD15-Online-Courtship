The traditional methods and timescale of seduction have been turned upside down.

In this production, social networks (Facebook, Twitter), smartphones, and texting all play important roles. It is always interesting to observe the impact of different technical interfaces on the way we fall in love. Each historical period brings its own combination of its values and approaches to love. Malkovich’s Parisian adaptation shows that the role of the written word in seduction and relationships is reinforced through the use of the Internet. Of course, as in the ‘classic’ age of love, we still find cynicism, hypocrisy, lies, and manipulation. But now, they are all technologically assisted.</Content>

Liberalism is implicitly present in the discourse of those on the Internet as much as it is in their online habits. This observation is based on surveys conducted on the subject by the author, in the French-speaking world, over the past ten years. The chapter will then discuss this phenomenon in the light of more general sociological reflections and philosophical considerations about love and the digital-network-era couple.</Content>

Online, you do not see who you are speaking to, and you do not know him or her because he or she is hidden behind a pseudonym and a screen. Likewise, things often move faster than in real life, where the temporality of seduction is often rather slow.

They see relationships in the Internet age as commodities, governed by the principles of utilitarianism. To say that this economic theory is gaining the domain of human relationships is more than just a metaphor. If we take certain expressions literally, they can be incidentally revealing. On the subject of dating websites, the Internet users interviewed spontaneously alluded to: a “shopping for love,” a “supermarket,” “business and commerce,” “unrestrained sexual consumption,” and a “store front window for singles.” There are many who said that they choose a partner “like you would pick a yogurt, or any product, shopping cart in hand.” In short, “people have the impression of becoming merchandise” once they sign up for a dating website. Some, disappointed by these sites, even mention prostitution, “since you pay to have relationships with a stranger”….

In fact, we see strong evidence of sociocultural kinship, an important organizing principle in the matrimonial market and thus in the make-up of couples.

    <Content>Through all of the texts and images exchanged amongst strangers on dating websites, we see that liberalism has invaded the sphere of human relations. You must be efficient, attractive, and noteworthy to rise above the crowd. You must always ‘perform’ well, with pictures that broadcast the message that you want to be received. Romantic relationships must yield productivity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The personal information pages put online must be sales-worthy and impactful in order to be noticed. These adjectives are a matter of marketing and coaching, which influence each type of intimate relationship. On dating sites, everyone conforms to the principles of romance marketing, considering themselves as exclusive products to promote, or one product in competition with thousands of others. In fact, on dating sites (like on social networks), many also indulge in personal branding, both consciously and subconsciously. In other words, they become their own brand. Once again, this is a notion and concept which takes us into the commercial domain.</Content>

It is as if these men are special products that you cannot miss, the deal of the day! In this realm, men have few rights; they must obey – and only obey. The site is livened up by a commercial metaphor in which the all-powerful female user does her ‘shopping’ with an online list that she drew up based on her criteria. This site demands a good sense of humor, but it has had a lot of success with its young clientele, who master the relationship codes on social networks. So even if the title may seem exaggerated, we are most certainly living in the realm of love won over by liberalism.</Content>

    <Content>Liberalism is expressed in an even more tangible manner when you think of online romantic/seductive encounters. The global expansion of dating sites allows us to detect, more largely, the rise of a new international singles market. Thus, tens of thousands of women living in developing countries or zones of political unrest are trying to emigrate to ‘rich’ countries, thanks to the dating website network. This matrimonial cyber-migration has opened a new type of migratory trend, lining the pockets of cyber-café owners. In a documentary titled “Nord-Sud.com” (North-South.com), the Frenchmen François Ducat explains that in 1997, there were four cyber cafés in Yaoundé, Cameroon, and 450 in 2007. </Content>

The competition is fierce and only the most attractive will be noticed. These women must simultaneously be pretty, docile, sensual, sweet, and offer hope for a meeting in Europe or North America. This international single life sees hordes of women from Africa, Asia, and ex-communist countries attempt to (and occasionally manage to) create a ‘cyber-union.’ Of course, one consequence is being uprooted from family and cultural lifestyle. These women will attempt to live a new life, far from home, (usually) with a white stranger who is wealthy and older then themselves. These men buy the ‘youth’ of these women in exchange for goods and a ‘better life.’ The success of these relationships varies. Some adapt to Western ways, while others are depressed, yet make sacrifices to stay. Then there are those who return to their country after seeing that it would be impossible to become integrated. Finally, many return after being disappointed or disillusioned by their Western ‘Prince Charming’.</Content>

    <Content>The model of the traditional couple is called into question by information and communication technologies. Clearly, the Internet ‘produces’ a good amount of couples. But, as a consequence, it also produces ‘defeats,’ as digital suitors reconnect for digital adultery, polygamy and ‘sexfriending.’ These sites have given birth to a type of recreational sexuality. In a parallel manner, the sentimentality produced by these digital networks is fun and disengaged, but also cynical – and occasionally hurtful in this regard. Our current era is one of mass sexual and romantic consumption. We take, we make the most of things, we enjoy those things, and we throw those things away. Of course, we must not forget the numerous beautiful love stories which also have their origin the Internet. However, those involved in these stories often encountered disappointment and suffering before finally finding a soulmate. This is due to the prevailing cynicism and the unpleasant impression of being referred to like a supermarket product, as others flip through a thick catalog full of people to be ‘consumed.’</Content>

Since you can seduce or be seduced online, and almost nobody shows it, casualness and immediate pleasure are the driving forces of the system. But just because something exists for a short amount of time, it does not mean that it will exist forever.

How many are there, additionally, who brag and count their dozens of simultaneous affairs and hundreds of ‘one night stands’? “If the abundance of possibilities can be reassuring, it can also take on the form of an indefinite, never-ending quest.

Multiply this by millions, and this sensation contributes to making the generation of Internet lovers nostalgic, yet disillusioned in facing the brutality of technologically advanced and liberalized relationships.

The Internet and dating sites have allowed us to opt for the sentimental-sexual model of interchangeability and ‘getting around,’ but only for a certain time. Despite the cynics and those who’ve been disappointed, a lot of singles on the Internet are convinced that a special person is hidden just behind a screen and that they will finally be in contact, like the androgynous couples of Plato.
